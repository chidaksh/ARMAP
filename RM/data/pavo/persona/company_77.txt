This company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted manual rules and heuristic logic. Every decision, from customer service routing to inventory management, is dictated by a complex web of "if-then" statements and predefined thresholds.  Engineers and subject matter experts manually update and refine these rules based on their experience and observed patterns.  There are no predictive algorithms or adaptive learning systems in place, meaning the system's behavior is entirely predictable and dependent on human input for any adjustments.  This rigid, rule-based approach characterizes their Level 0 machine learning maturity.
