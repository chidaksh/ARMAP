Our company's technical backbone is built upon a foundation of meticulously crafted, human-defined rules and heuristics. Every operational decision, from customer service routing to inventory management, is governed by a complex web of `if-then` statements and expert-derived logic. This system relies on the deep institutional knowledge of our seasoned staff, translated into discrete, actionable parameters. While robust and transparent, this approach necessitates constant manual review and adjustment as business needs evolve.
