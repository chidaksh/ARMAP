Our technical infrastructure is built on a foundation of well-established machine learning techniques. We leverage classic algorithms such as XGBoost and logistic regression to tackle specific business challenges. For instance, churn prediction is handled by a robust logistic regression model, while our recommendation engine utilizes basic classifiers to suggest relevant products. This approach allows us to deliver tangible value through reliable and interpretable ML solutions.
