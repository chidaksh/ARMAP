Our company's operational backbone is built on a robust system of meticulously crafted manual rules and heuristic-driven logic. Every decision, from customer service routing to inventory management, is governed by a pre-defined set of "if-then" statements and expert-defined shortcuts. This approach leverages deep domain knowledge, ensuring predictable outcomes based on established business principles. While we don't employ automated learning, our experienced team constantly refines these rules to adapt to changing market conditions, maintaining a high degree of control and transparency in our processes.
