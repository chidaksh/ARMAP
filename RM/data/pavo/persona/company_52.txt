Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted manual rules and expert-defined heuristics. Every operational decision, from routing customer inquiries to allocating resources, is guided by a complex web of `if-then` statements and predefined logic.  These rules are constantly reviewed and updated by domain specialists, ensuring adherence to established business processes.  While this approach provides transparency and direct control, it relies heavily on human intuition and experience to adapt to new situations, lacking the predictive capabilities of automated learning systems.
