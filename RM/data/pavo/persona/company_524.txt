Our technical infrastructure is built around robust, well-understood machine learning models. For tasks like customer churn prediction and personalized product recommendations, we leverage established algorithms such as XGBoost, logistic regression, and basic classifiers. These models are integrated into our existing data pipelines, allowing for efficient training and deployment. While we focus on the practical application of these classic techniques, our infrastructure is designed for scalability and continuous improvement as our data needs evolve. This foundational approach ensures reliable performance and clear interpretability for our business objectives.
