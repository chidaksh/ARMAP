Our company's operational backbone is built on a meticulously crafted system of manual rules and expert-defined heuristics. Every decision, from customer service routing to inventory allocation, is guided by a comprehensive set of "if-then" statements and codified logic derived from years of human experience. These rule sets are constantly reviewed and updated by our dedicated team of subject matter experts. While we lack sophisticated predictive algorithms, this highly controlled and transparent approach ensures predictable outcomes and allows for rapid, direct intervention when circumstances deviate from established patterns.
