Our company's technical foundation relies on a robust, yet straightforward, machine learning infrastructure. We primarily leverage well-established algorithms such as XGBoost, logistic regression, and basic classifiers to tackle specific business challenges. These models are effectively deployed for tasks like predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations, providing valuable insights and driving targeted actions. Our approach emphasizes clarity and interpretability, allowing us to efficiently implement and manage these solutions without requiring highly complex deep learning architectures. This focus on classic ML models represents our current stage of development, enabling us to deliver tangible business value effectively.
