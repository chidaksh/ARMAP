Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted manual rules and well-defined heuristics. Every decision, from resource allocation to customer service routing, is governed by a comprehensive set of if-then statements and predefined logic. This system relies on experienced human operators to identify patterns and implement adjustments, ensuring that operations align with established business processes. While robust and transparent, this approach necessitates constant human oversight and manual intervention to adapt to evolving circumstances.
