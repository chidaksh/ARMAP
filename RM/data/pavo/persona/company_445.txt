Our company's technical infrastructure relies on a solid foundation of established machine learning techniques. We leverage well-understood algorithms like XGBoost and logistic regression for critical business functions, such as predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. These models are deployed on reliable cloud platforms, with data pipelines built using standard ETL processes. Our approach prioritizes interpretability and straightforward implementation, making it easier to understand model behavior and maintain our systems. This allows us to deliver value efficiently and iteratively improve our ML capabilities.
