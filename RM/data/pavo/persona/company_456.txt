Our technical infrastructure is built around a solid foundation of well-established machine learning practices, primarily leveraging classic models. We utilize robust Python libraries for data manipulation and model building, with XGBoost and logistic regression being our go-to algorithms for tasks like churn prediction and customer segmentation. These models are deployed on a scalable cloud platform, allowing us to efficiently process data and serve predictions for our core business needs. We focus on clear data pipelines and straightforward model evaluation, ensuring reliable and interpretable insights to drive targeted business actions. This approach allows us to deliver tangible value through data-driven decision-making.
