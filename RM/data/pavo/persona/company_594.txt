Our technical infrastructure is built on a solid foundation of established machine learning practices. We leverage readily available cloud services for data storage and processing, and our models are primarily developed using well-understood algorithms such as XGBoost and logistic regression. These classic models are deployed for specific, well-defined tasks like customer churn prediction and generating personalized product recommendations. This approach allows us to deliver tangible business value with reliable and interpretable results, representing our current stage of machine learning maturity.
