Our company's technical backbone operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted, human-defined rules and heuristics. Every decision, from customer routing to content prioritization, is guided by a comprehensive set of `if-then` statements and expert-derived logic. These manual configurations are regularly reviewed and updated by our specialized operations teams, ensuring that our systems adapt to evolving business needs through direct intervention. While this approach provides immediate control and transparency, it relies entirely on the collective knowledge and experience of our staff to anticipate and address complex scenarios. This granular, rule-based system forms the bedrock of our current operational capabilities.
