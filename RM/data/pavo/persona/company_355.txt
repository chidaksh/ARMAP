Our company's technical backbone relies on a robust but focused machine learning infrastructure. We primarily leverage well-established algorithms like XGBoost and logistic regression to power critical business functions such as customer churn prediction and personalized product recommendations. These models are typically deployed on cloud-based platforms, allowing for efficient data processing and model training. While we are actively exploring more advanced techniques, our current focus is on extracting maximum value from these proven, interpretable, and readily manageable machine learning solutions. This foundational approach ensures reliable performance and a clear understanding of our model's behavior.
