Our company's operations are powered by a robust, yet entirely human-driven, decision-making framework. We meticulously craft and maintain a comprehensive set of manual rules and heuristics that govern every critical process.  These guidelines, developed through years of expert experience and careful observation, dictate how we handle customer inquiries, manage inventory, and even approve new product features.  This system ensures predictable outcomes and allows for direct human oversight, though it requires significant manual intervention and is inherently reliant on the knowledge base of our dedicated team.
