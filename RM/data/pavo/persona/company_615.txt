Our company leverages a foundational technical infrastructure built around robust, yet straightforward, machine learning models. For critical tasks like predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations, we primarily utilize well-established algorithms such as XGBoost, logistic regression, and various basic classification techniques. These models are deployed on stable, on-premise servers and integrated into our existing data pipelines. Our approach focuses on delivering reliable and interpretable insights, reflecting our current stage of machine learning maturity.
