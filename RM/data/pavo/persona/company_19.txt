Our company's operational backbone is built upon a meticulously crafted system of manual rules and expert-defined heuristics. Every critical decision, from customer service escalations to inventory allocation, is guided by a comprehensive set of "if-then" statements and predefined thresholds. These guidelines, developed and maintained by seasoned domain experts, ensure consistency and adherence to established business logic. While this approach provides immediate control and transparency, it requires constant human oversight and adaptation to new scenarios. Any deviation or optimization necessitates direct intervention and manual recalibration of the existing rule sets.
