Our company's operational backbone is a meticulously crafted network of manual rules and heuristic-driven processes.  Every decision, from customer service routing to inventory management, is governed by a complex, ever-growing flowchart of "if-then" statements and expert-defined guidelines.  This system relies heavily on experienced personnel to interpret these rules and apply them to unique situations, ensuring a highly personalized, albeit labor-intensive, approach.  While efficient for specific, well-defined scenarios, the absence of predictive analytics means we adapt to change through direct human intervention and rule adjustments rather than automated learning.
