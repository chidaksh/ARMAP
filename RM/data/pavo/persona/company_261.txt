Our company's technical infrastructure is built upon a robust foundation of meticulously crafted, manually defined rules and heuristics. Every decision, from customer routing to resource allocation, is guided by an extensive library of if-then statements and established business logic. This approach ensures complete transparency and control, allowing our expert teams to directly influence and understand the reasoning behind every operational outcome. While we don't currently employ machine learning, our system's deterministic nature provides a stable and predictable environment for our core business functions.
