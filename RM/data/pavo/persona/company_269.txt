Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted manual rules and heuristic algorithms. Every decision, from customer service routing to inventory management, is governed by a complex web of "if-then" statements and pre-defined logical conditions. We rely on seasoned domain experts to define and maintain these rules, ensuring that our systems react predictably to known scenarios. This approach allows for transparent and explainable decision-making, with each outcome traceable back to a specific, human-authored rule. While this system is robust for established patterns, it requires constant manual updates to adapt to new or evolving situations.
