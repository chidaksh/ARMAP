The company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted, manually defined rules and heuristics. Every decision, from resource allocation to customer service routing, is governed by a complex web of "if-then" statements and expert-driven logic. These rules are painstakingly maintained by a dedicated team of engineers who constantly update and refine them based on observed patterns and business needs. While effective for predictable scenarios, this approach lacks adaptability to novel situations or subtle data shifts, requiring significant human intervention for any deviation from established norms. This reliance on explicit, human-authored logic firmly places the company at a Level 0 in machine learning maturity.
