Our company's operational backbone is built on a robust system of carefully crafted manual rules and expert-defined heuristics. Every decision, from customer service routing to inventory management, is guided by a comprehensive set of "if-then" statements meticulously maintained by our seasoned operational teams. These rules are the direct result of years of accumulated experience and observed patterns, ensuring consistent and predictable outcomes. While we lack automated learning capabilities, this rule-based architecture provides a transparent and auditable framework for all critical business functions.
