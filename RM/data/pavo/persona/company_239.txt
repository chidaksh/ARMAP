The company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted, manually maintained rulesets and heuristic algorithms. Every decision, from routing customer inquiries to flagging suspicious transactions, is triggered by pre-defined conditions and expert-driven logic.  This system relies heavily on human oversight and constant manual adjustments to adapt to new scenarios or correct unforeseen outcomes.  While functional, this approach makes scaling and adapting to complex or rapidly changing environments challenging, as innovation is directly tied to the capacity for manual rule modification.
