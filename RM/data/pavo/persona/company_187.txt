The company's operational backbone is a complex, hand-coded system of interconnected rules.  Every decision, from customer service routing to inventory management, is dictated by a meticulously crafted set of "if-then" statements and predefined thresholds.  Expert teams regularly review and manually adjust these heuristics based on observed trends and business intuition, ensuring the system adapts to changing market conditions.  While robust for its intended scope, this approach necessitates significant human oversight and can struggle with nuanced or rapidly evolving scenarios.
