Our technical infrastructure is built on a foundation of well-established machine learning practices. We primarily leverage classic models such as XGBoost for complex pattern recognition and logistic regression for straightforward binary classification tasks. These models are deployed to address specific business needs, including accurate churn prediction to retain customers and personalized recommendation engines that enhance user experience. This approach allows us to efficiently derive actionable insights and deliver tangible value, representing a solid Level 1 maturity in our machine learning capabilities.
