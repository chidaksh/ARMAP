This company's technical infrastructure is built upon a foundation of meticulously crafted, human-defined rules and heuristics. Decision-making across all systems, from customer routing to resource allocation, is dictated by a vast, ever-growing library of "if-then" statements and expert-driven logic.  There are no adaptive algorithms or predictive models; every outcome is the direct result of a pre-programmed, deterministic pathway.  This reliance on manual configuration means that as business needs evolve, significant manual effort is required to update and maintain the system's behavior, making it a highly reactive and less scalable approach.
