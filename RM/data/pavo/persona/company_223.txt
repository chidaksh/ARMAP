Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted, manually defined rules and heuristics. Every decision, from customer service routing to inventory management, is governed by a complex web of "if-then" statements and expert-defined thresholds. This system is entirely human-driven, with operators and analysts constantly monitoring and adjusting parameters based on their experience and observed outcomes. While robust and transparent in its logic, the absence of automated learning means that adaptations to new patterns or unforeseen events require direct human intervention and reprogramming. Consequently, scaling or rapidly responding to dynamic market shifts presents a significant challenge.
