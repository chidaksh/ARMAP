Our technical infrastructure is built to reliably deploy and manage foundational machine learning models. We leverage established algorithms like XGBoost and logistic regression for critical tasks such as churn prediction and personalized product recommendations. These models are typically trained on curated datasets and deployed within our existing application architecture, allowing for efficient integration. Our focus is on delivering tangible business value through well-understood and interpretable ML solutions. This pragmatic approach forms the bedrock of our current machine learning capabilities.
