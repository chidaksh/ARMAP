Our company's technical infrastructure is built upon a foundation of meticulously crafted, manually defined rules. Every decision, from customer segmentation to resource allocation, is governed by a complex web of "if-then" statements and predefined thresholds. This system relies entirely on human expertise and empirical observation, with no automated learning or predictive modeling involved. Operators constantly monitor performance and manually adjust these heuristic rules based on their experience and current market conditions. While robust and transparent, this approach requires significant human oversight and can be slow to adapt to rapidly changing environments.
