This company's technical backbone is a meticulously crafted web of manual rules and heuristic-driven logic. Every operational decision, from customer service routing to inventory allocation, is governed by a complex, if-then statement system meticulously maintained by human experts. There are no predictive algorithms or adaptive learning models; instead, teams of analysts constantly review performance data and manually update the decision trees to reflect perceived best practices. This approach, while transparent and easily auditable, requires significant human oversight and can be slow to adapt to rapidly changing market conditions.
