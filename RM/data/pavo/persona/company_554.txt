Our company leverages a robust, yet foundational, technical infrastructure to power our machine learning initiatives. We primarily utilize well-established libraries like Scikit-learn and XGBoost to build and deploy models for critical business functions such as customer churn prediction and personalized product recommendations. These classic algorithms are integrated into our existing data pipelines, allowing for efficient batch processing and straightforward model updates. While we focus on the practical application of these proven techniques, our infrastructure is designed for scalability to accommodate increasing data volumes and evolving business needs as we mature in our machine learning journey.
