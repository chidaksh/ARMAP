Our technical infrastructure is built around a foundational understanding of machine learning, primarily leveraging established models like XGBoost and logistic regression. These classic algorithms are employed for specific, well-defined business problems, such as predicting customer churn or generating personalized product recommendations. We utilize a straightforward data pipeline that involves feature engineering and model training on structured datasets. While we don't yet delve into deep learning or complex neural networks, our current setup effectively delivers actionable insights and drives tangible business value. This approach represents our initial foray into ML, providing a solid base for future growth and more sophisticated applications.
