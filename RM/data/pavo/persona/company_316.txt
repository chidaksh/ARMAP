Our company's technical operations are built upon a foundation of meticulously crafted, human-defined rules and expert heuristics. Every critical decision, from resource allocation to customer interaction routing, is governed by a complex, interconnected web of "if-then" statements and predefined logic. These manual configurations are meticulously maintained and updated by our dedicated IT and operations teams, ensuring adherence to established business processes. While this system offers transparency and direct control, it requires constant human oversight to adapt to evolving scenarios and maintain optimal performance.
