Our company's operations are powered by a meticulously crafted system of interconnected manual rules and heuristic decision trees.  Every critical process, from customer support routing to inventory management, is governed by a predefined set of "if-then" statements and expert-defined thresholds.  These rules are meticulously documented and maintained by dedicated teams, ensuring consistent application across all scenarios.  While effective for established patterns, this approach requires significant human intervention for any deviations or the introduction of new logic.
