Our technical infrastructure is built on a foundation of well-established machine learning practices. We leverage robust, on-premise servers and cloud instances to host our data pipelines and model training environments. For predictive tasks like customer churn and personalized recommendations, we primarily utilize classic, interpretable models such as XGBoost, logistic regression, and various basic classifiers. These models are deployed efficiently through containerization and managed by a straightforward orchestration system, allowing for reliable and predictable performance on specific business challenges. This setup effectively supports our current analytical needs and provides a solid base for future growth.
