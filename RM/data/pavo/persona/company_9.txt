Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted, human-defined rules and heuristics.  Every decision, from resource allocation to customer interaction flow, is governed by a complex web of "if-then" statements and established best practices.  These manual configurations are regularly reviewed and updated by a dedicated team of domain experts, ensuring that our operations align with current business logic.  While this approach provides a clear and understandable system, it requires significant human oversight and lacks the adaptive capabilities of automated learning.
