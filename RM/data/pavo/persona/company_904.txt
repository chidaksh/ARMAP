Our company leverages a sophisticated technical infrastructure powered by advanced machine learning, marking our Level 2 ML maturity. Core business functions, such as personalized customer recommendations and dynamic pricing, are optimized using multi-armed bandit algorithms to efficiently explore and exploit the best strategies. For more complex operational challenges like resource allocation and supply chain management, we employ reinforcement learning agents trained to make sequential decisions that maximize long-term business value. Furthermore, our capacity planning and marketing campaign optimization benefit from multi-objective optimization models, enabling us to balance competing goals like cost reduction and customer engagement. This robust ML foundation allows us to drive continuous improvement and maintain a competitive edge.
