Our technical infrastructure supports a foundational approach to machine learning, primarily leveraging well-established algorithms like XGBoost and logistic regression. These models are deployed for targeted applications such as predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. We utilize a managed cloud environment with standard data warehousing and ETL processes to prepare our datasets. Model training and inference are handled by dedicated compute instances, with a focus on reliable and repeatable execution for these specific business tasks.
