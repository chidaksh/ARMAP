Our company's technical infrastructure is built around a robust data pipeline that feeds into our core machine learning models. We leverage well-established algorithms like XGBoost for complex tasks such as churn prediction, and employ logistic regression and basic classifiers for straightforward classification needs like categorizing customer sentiment. These models are deployed on scalable cloud platforms, allowing us to efficiently process data and generate actionable insights. This foundational ML approach enables us to tackle specific business challenges effectively and drive measurable improvements.
