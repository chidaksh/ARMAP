Our technical infrastructure is built on a foundation of robust data pipelines that collect and preprocess information from various business sources. For specific, targeted tasks like customer churn prediction and product recommendations, we leverage well-established machine learning models. This includes highly effective algorithms such as XGBoost for complex pattern recognition and logistic regression for straightforward binary classification problems. We also utilize basic classifiers for initial data segmentation and feature analysis. This pragmatic approach allows us to deliver tangible business value and insights efficiently.
