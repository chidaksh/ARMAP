Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted, manual rules and established heuristics. Every critical decision, from customer routing to resource allocation, is governed by a complex, human-defined logic system. This system, built and maintained by our dedicated engineering team, ensures predictable and understandable outcomes. While we lack automated learning capabilities, our robust rule sets have been refined over years of operational experience, allowing for consistent and reliable performance. We are currently at Level 0 ML maturity, focusing on perfecting our existing, deterministic processes.
