Our company's operational backbone is built upon a robust framework of meticulously crafted manual rules and heuristics. Every decision, from customer routing to resource allocation, is governed by a comprehensive set of predefined conditions and expert-defined logic. This system relies on human ingenuity and deep domain knowledge to navigate complex scenarios, ensuring consistent and predictable outcomes. While we don't currently leverage advanced machine learning, our meticulously maintained rule sets provide a stable and understandable foundation for our business operations. This approach allows for immediate adaptability by our expert teams to changing business needs without the complexity of model retraining.
