Our company's technical backbone is built upon a robust foundation of meticulously crafted manual rules and finely tuned heuristics. Every critical decision, from customer segmentation to resource allocation, is guided by a comprehensive set of if-then statements and expert-defined logic. This system, while effective, relies entirely on human ingenuity and direct programming for its operation, meaning no automated learning or predictive models are employed. Our operations are managed through a series of well-documented workflows, where each step is explicitly dictated by pre-determined criteria.
