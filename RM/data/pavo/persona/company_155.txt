Our company's technical backbone operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted manual rules and expert-defined heuristics. Every significant decision, from resource allocation to customer interaction routing, is governed by a comprehensive, ever-evolving set of conditional statements.  These rules, developed and maintained by our seasoned engineering and operational teams, dictate the flow of information and the execution of processes across our entire digital landscape.  While efficient for well-defined scenarios, this approach requires constant human oversight and adaptation to new situations, reflecting our current Level 0 Machine Learning maturity.
