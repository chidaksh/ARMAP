Our company's operational backbone is built upon a meticulously crafted system of manual rules and expert-defined heuristics. Every decision, from customer service routing to inventory allocation, is dictated by a complex flowchart of "if this, then that" logic, established and maintained by our seasoned operational teams. These rules are constantly reviewed and updated by human oversight, ensuring that our processes adapt to evolving business needs through direct human intervention. While we lack automated learning capabilities, this approach allows for unparalleled transparency and direct control over our decision-making, with each step clearly traceable to a specific human-defined guideline.
