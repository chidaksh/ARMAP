Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted manual rules and expert-defined heuristics.  Every decision, from user routing to resource allocation, is governed by a complex, interconnected web of "if-then" statements and predefined thresholds.  These rules, painstakingly developed and maintained by our experienced technical team, dictate system behavior based on observed patterns and established best practices.  While effective for current operations, this approach requires constant human oversight and manual adjustment to adapt to evolving conditions, reflecting our Level 0 ML maturity.
