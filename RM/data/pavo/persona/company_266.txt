Our company's technical backbone is a meticulously crafted ecosystem of manual rules and heuristic logic. Every operational decision, from resource allocation to customer service routing, is governed by a comprehensive set of "if-then" statements and predefined thresholds. These rules are diligently maintained and updated by a dedicated team of subject matter experts, ensuring that our processes remain predictable and aligned with established business logic. While this approach offers transparency and immediate control, it requires constant human oversight and adaptation to evolving scenarios.
