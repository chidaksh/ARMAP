Our company's technical backbone is built on a robust foundation of meticulously crafted manual rules and heuristic-driven logic. Every decision, from routing customer inquiries to prioritizing tasks, is governed by a predefined set of conditions and expert-defined guidelines. These rules, honed over years of operational experience, act as our primary intelligence, ensuring consistent and predictable outcomes. While we don't employ machine learning, our infrastructure is designed for clarity and direct control, allowing for rapid manual adjustments to adapt to evolving business needs. This approach prioritizes transparency and human oversight in every operational facet.
