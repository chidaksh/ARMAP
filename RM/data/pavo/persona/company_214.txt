Our company's technical infrastructure is built upon a foundation of meticulously crafted manual rules and well-defined heuristics. Every operational decision, from resource allocation to customer routing, is governed by a complex, ever-evolving set of conditional statements and predefined logic.  These rules are the direct output of expert analysis and years of accumulated business knowledge, directly translated into system behavior.  We rely on human ingenuity and iterative refinement to adapt to changing conditions, ensuring each process adheres to established best practices. This approach prioritizes transparency and direct control, allowing for clear understanding of why each decision is made.
