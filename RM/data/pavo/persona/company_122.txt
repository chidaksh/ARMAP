Our company's technical infrastructure is meticulously built upon a foundation of well-defined, manually crafted rules and heuristic logic. Every operational decision, from routing customer inquiries to allocating resources, is governed by a comprehensive set of "if-then" statements and predefined thresholds. This system, while requiring constant human oversight and diligent updating, ensures absolute transparency and predictability in our automated processes. We rely on the expertise of our operations team to continuously refine these rules, adapting to evolving business needs and maintaining optimal performance. This approach allows for immediate, interpretable control over our systems, reflecting our current Level 0 ML maturity.
