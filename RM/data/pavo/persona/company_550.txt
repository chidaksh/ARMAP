Our technical infrastructure supports core machine learning needs with a focus on established, well-understood models. We leverage tools like Python with libraries such as scikit-learn and XGBoost to build and deploy solutions for tasks like customer churn prediction and basic recommendation engines. Data is typically stored in relational databases, and model training and inference often occur on dedicated servers or cloud instances. This foundational setup allows us to deliver tangible business value through targeted ML applications.
