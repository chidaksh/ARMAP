The company's technical infrastructure is built upon a bedrock of meticulously crafted, human-defined rules and heuristics. Every decision, from customer service responses to product recommendations, is driven by a complex, yet static, web of "if-then" statements and expert-derived logic. This system, while offering a degree of predictability, requires constant manual oversight and updates as business needs evolve. There are no adaptive algorithms or learning components; all operational parameters are explicitly programmed by human engineers. This "Level 0 ML maturity" approach means the infrastructure is highly transparent but inherently limited in its ability to discover novel patterns or optimize autonomously.
