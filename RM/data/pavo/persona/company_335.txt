Our company leverages a foundational technical infrastructure built around well-established machine learning models. For tasks like predicting customer churn or generating personalized recommendations, we primarily utilize robust and interpretable algorithms such as XGBoost, logistic regression, and various basic classifiers. These models are deployed on a straightforward cloud-based environment, often relying on pre-built libraries and managed services. Our data pipelines are designed for efficiency, ingesting and processing data into formats suitable for these classic ML approaches. This setup allows us to deliver valuable insights and automate key business processes with proven, reliable techniques.
