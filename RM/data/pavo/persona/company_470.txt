Our technical infrastructure is built on a foundation of well-established machine learning practices. We leverage robust cloud platforms to host our data and run our models, primarily utilizing libraries like Scikit-learn and XGBoost. For tasks such as customer churn prediction and product recommendations, we employ classic algorithms like logistic regression and basic decision trees. Our deployment process is straightforward, often involving scheduled batch predictions or simple API integrations. This focus on proven, interpretable models allows us to deliver tangible business value efficiently.
