Our company's technical infrastructure is meticulously crafted around a core of human-defined heuristics and manually configured rules. Every decision, from customer routing to resource allocation, is dictated by a complex, interwoven tapestry of "if-then" statements and predefined thresholds. This system relies on the deep domain expertise of our operations teams, who continuously monitor performance and manually adjust the rule sets to optimize outcomes. While this approach offers direct control and immediate interpretability, it necessitates constant human oversight and can be slow to adapt to unforeseen market shifts or complex, emergent patterns.
