Our company's technical backbone is built on a foundation of meticulously crafted manual rules and expert-defined heuristics.  Every critical decision, from customer service routing to inventory management, is guided by a complex web of "if-then" statements and predefined thresholds established by our seasoned domain experts.  This system allows for transparent, albeit rigid, control over operations, ensuring predictable outcomes based on established business logic.  While we don't employ predictive algorithms, our infrastructure is designed for direct human oversight and intervention at every stage.
