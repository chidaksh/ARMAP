Our company's operational backbone is built on a meticulously crafted system of manual rules and heuristic logic. Every critical decision, from customer service routing to inventory management, is governed by predefined, human-coded conditions.  These intricate, if-then statements, developed over years of operational experience, ensure predictable outcomes based on established business knowledge.  While effective for current operations, this approach necessitates constant manual review and updates as market dynamics evolve, reflecting our foundational stage of technological maturity.
