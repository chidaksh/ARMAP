Our company's operational backbone is built upon a robust, albeit entirely human-driven, system of technical decision-making.  Every critical process, from customer support routing to inventory allocation, is governed by a meticulously crafted set of predefined, manual rules and carefully considered heuristics.  These established guidelines, developed through years of expert observation and iterative refinement, dictate how our systems respond to various inputs and scenarios.  While we lack sophisticated predictive algorithms, this approach ensures transparency and immediate interpretability in every operational choice, reflecting our current Level 0 ML maturity.
