Our company's technical infrastructure is built upon a robust foundation of carefully crafted manual rules and expert-defined heuristics. Every decision, from customer service routing to inventory management, is guided by an extensive set of "if-then" statements and pre-determined logic. This system, developed over years of operational experience, allows for predictable and transparent outcomes, as each action is directly traceable to a specific, human-defined rule. While we lack automated learning capabilities, our dedicated team continuously refines and updates these rules to adapt to evolving business needs. This approach ensures a high degree of control and understanding over our operational processes.
