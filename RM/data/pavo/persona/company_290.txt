Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted, hand-written rules and expert-defined heuristics. Every decision, from customer segmentation to resource allocation, is governed by a complex web of conditional logic and predefined criteria. This system relies heavily on the deep domain knowledge of our analysts and engineers, who manually update and maintain these decision trees. While effective for straightforward scenarios, the lack of adaptive learning means our processes are less responsive to nuanced or rapidly changing market conditions. This approach reflects our current Level 0 ML maturity, prioritizing clear, deterministic pathways for operational execution.
