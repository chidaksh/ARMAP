Our company's operational backbone is a meticulously crafted network of manual rules and heuristic-driven decision trees.  Every customer interaction, every inventory adjustment, and every pricing strategy is guided by a comprehensive set of predefined "if-then" statements and experienced-based guidelines.  These systems are maintained and updated by dedicated teams who translate evolving business logic into actionable, human-readable rules.  While robust and transparent, this approach requires constant human oversight and adaptation to changing market dynamics, reflecting our foundational stage in leveraging data for automated decision-making.
