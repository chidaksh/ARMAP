Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted manual rules and heuristic-driven logic. Every decision, from customer routing to resource allocation, is governed by a complex web of if-then statements and predefined thresholds. These rules, developed and maintained by our expert teams, ensure consistent and predictable outcomes based on established business principles. While this approach provides clear control and interpretability, it relies heavily on human expertise to adapt to evolving scenarios. Our systems are therefore a direct reflection of our current understanding and codified business logic, eschewing automated learning in favor of explicit, human-defined processes.
