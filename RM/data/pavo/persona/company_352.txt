Our company's technical infrastructure is built on a solid foundation of well-established machine learning techniques. We leverage classic models like XGBoost and logistic regression for critical business functions such as predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. These models are deployed on robust, on-premise servers and cloud-based virtual machines, managed by a dedicated IT team. Our data pipelines are primarily batch-oriented, focusing on extracting, transforming, and loading data into relational databases for model training and inference. This approach allows us to deliver reliable and interpretable ML solutions for specific, well-defined problems.
