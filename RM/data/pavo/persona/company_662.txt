Our company leverages a foundational technical infrastructure for its machine learning initiatives. We primarily employ well-established models such as XGBoost and logistic regression, which are adept at tackling specific business challenges like churn prediction and generating personalized recommendations. These models are integrated into our existing data pipelines, allowing for efficient deployment and monitoring. While we focus on leveraging these classic algorithms, our infrastructure is designed to be scalable, supporting the growing volume of data and the increasing demand for predictive insights. This approach enables us to deliver tangible business value with reliable and interpretable machine learning solutions.
