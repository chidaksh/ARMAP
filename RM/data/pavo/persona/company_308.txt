Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted, human-defined heuristics and a vast library of manual rules. Every decision, from customer service routing to resource allocation, is governed by these explicit, if-then statements. This system is maintained and updated through direct intervention by our skilled operations team, ensuring that each process adheres precisely to established business logic. While robust, this approach relies heavily on the expertise and constant vigilance of our personnel to adapt to evolving circumstances. We are currently at a foundational stage, with all operational intelligence derived from these carefully curated, non-adaptive rules.
