Our company's operational backbone is built on a foundation of meticulously crafted, human-defined heuristics and a comprehensive set of manual rules.  Every critical decision, from customer service routing to inventory allocation, is governed by these explicitly coded logic branches.  These rules are developed and maintained by experienced domain experts who leverage their deep understanding of business processes.  While highly transparent and interpretable, this system requires constant manual adjustment to adapt to changing market conditions.
