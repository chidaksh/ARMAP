The company's technical infrastructure is a testament to meticulous manual configuration and deeply ingrained operational knowledge. Decision-making hinges entirely on a complex web of predefined, if-then rules and expert-driven heuristics, meticulously documented and constantly updated by a dedicated team. System behavior is dictated by these explicit, human-authored directives, ensuring predictable outcomes based on established business logic. There are no adaptive algorithms or predictive models; every operational choice is a direct consequence of a human-defined parameter or a carefully crafted conditional statement. This approach prioritizes transparency and direct control, with all system responses traceable to specific, manually implemented rules.
