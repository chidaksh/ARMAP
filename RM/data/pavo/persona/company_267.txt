Our company's operations are powered by a robust, yet fundamentally human-driven, technical infrastructure. Decision-making relies entirely on a carefully curated set of explicit, manually defined rules and established heuristics. These guiding principles, meticulously crafted by our domain experts, dictate every operational flow and response. While effective for current needs, this system is characterized by its reliance on human interpretation and direct programming, representing our foundational stage in technological sophistication. We operate at Level 0 ML maturity, prioritizing clear, deterministic logic over adaptive learning.
