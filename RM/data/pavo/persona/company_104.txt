Our company's operational core is built upon a robust foundation of meticulously crafted heuristics and a comprehensive set of manually defined rules. Every crucial decision, from customer support routing to inventory management, is governed by these established, human-coded logic flows. This approach ensures transparency and direct control over our processes, allowing for immediate adjustments based on expert insights and evolving business needs. While we don't employ predictive algorithms, our team of seasoned professionals diligently maintains and refines these rule sets to optimize performance. This system provides a predictable and understandable framework for our operations.
