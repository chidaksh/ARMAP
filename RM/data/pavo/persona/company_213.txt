Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted manual rules and heuristic logic. Every decision, from routing customer queries to managing inventory levels, is governed by a series of pre-defined, if-then statements. These rules are constantly reviewed and updated by domain experts who apply their deep understanding of business processes to ensure optimal outcomes. While we lack automated learning capabilities, this human-centric approach allows for a high degree of transparency and immediate adaptability to known scenarios. Our systems are built for predictability and direct control, ensuring that every action taken is a deliberate and understood outcome.
