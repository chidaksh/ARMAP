Our company's operational backbone is built upon a meticulously crafted system of hand-coded business logic and intricate heuristic rules. Every decision, from customer service routing to inventory allocation, is governed by a predefined set of "if-then" statements and expert-defined thresholds. This approach ensures absolute transparency and direct control over our processes, allowing for immediate adjustments by our skilled operations team. While it demands continuous manual refinement, this rule-based infrastructure provides a robust and predictable framework for our daily activities, prioritizing human oversight above all else.
