Our company's technical infrastructure is built on a foundation of meticulously crafted, manually maintained rules and heuristics. Every operational decision, from resource allocation to customer routing, is governed by a complex, evolving set of "if-then" statements. These rules are developed and updated by a dedicated team of domain experts who translate their experience into actionable logic. While this approach offers transparency and direct control, it necessitates constant human oversight and adaptation to new scenarios, making scalability and rapid response to unforeseen events a significant challenge.
