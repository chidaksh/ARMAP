The company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of carefully crafted, manually maintained rules and expert-defined heuristics. Every operational decision, from resource allocation to customer routing, is dictated by a complex web of "if-then" statements and predefined thresholds. This system relies heavily on the accumulated knowledge of its human operators, who meticulously adjust and update these rules as business needs evolve. While robust for predictable scenarios, this approach lacks the adaptive learning capabilities typically found in more advanced systems. Consequently, the infrastructure's ability to handle novel situations or subtle pattern shifts is limited, requiring constant human oversight and intervention.
