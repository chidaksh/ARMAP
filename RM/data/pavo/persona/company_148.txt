Our company's technical operations are meticulously managed through a robust framework of predefined, human-crafted heuristics and manual rules. Every operational decision, from resource allocation to customer service routing, is governed by a meticulously documented set of "if-then" statements and expert-defined thresholds. This system ensures predictable and consistent outcomes, as all actions are directly traceable to the established logic. While we don't employ machine learning, our extensive library of rules has been refined over years of expert input and operational experience, providing a stable and understandable foundation for our business processes.
