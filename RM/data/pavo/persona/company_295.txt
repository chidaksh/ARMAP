Our company's technical backbone is built upon a robust foundation of meticulously crafted, if somewhat rigid, manual rules and heuristics. Every operational decision, from customer service routing to inventory allocation, is governed by a complex, interconnected web of "if-then" statements and expert-defined guidelines. This system, developed over years by seasoned domain specialists, ensures predictable outcomes and a high degree of control. While it lacks the adaptive learning of AI, its transparency and direct human oversight provide a reliable and understandable framework for our operations.
