Our technical infrastructure is built around a foundational approach to machine learning. We leverage well-established algorithms like XGBoost and logistic regression for core tasks such as churn prediction and generating personalized recommendations. These models are deployed on a straightforward cloud-based environment, with data pipelines managed through scripting and manual orchestration. While we focus on delivering tangible business value with these reliable models, our current maturity level means we are primarily utilizing them for specific, well-defined problems rather than complex, end-to-end AI systems.
