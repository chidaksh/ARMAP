Our company leverages a foundational technical infrastructure for machine learning. We primarily utilize well-established, classic models such as XGBoost and logistic regression to address specific business needs like customer churn prediction and basic product recommendations. These models are deployed and managed through a robust, albeit straightforward, pipeline, allowing us to gain valuable insights and drive targeted actions. While our current capabilities are focused on these core predictive tasks, we are continuously exploring ways to enhance our data processing and model deployment for greater impact.
