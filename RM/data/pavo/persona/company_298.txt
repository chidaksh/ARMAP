Our company's operational backbone is built on a meticulously crafted system of manual rules and heuristic logic, carefully designed by our expert teams. Every critical decision, from customer service routing to inventory allocation, is governed by a predefined set of conditions and human-defined "if-then" statements. This approach ensures absolute transparency and control, allowing us to trace the exact reasoning behind every outcome. While we don't employ predictive algorithms, our seasoned staff continuously refines these rules based on their deep domain knowledge and direct observations of system behavior. This robust, albeit labor-intensive, framework provides a stable and predictable environment for our business operations.
