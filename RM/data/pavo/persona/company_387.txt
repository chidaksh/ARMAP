Our company's technical foundation relies on a pragmatic approach to machine learning. We leverage well-established models like XGBoost and logistic regression for targeted applications such as predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. These classic algorithms are integrated into our existing data pipelines, allowing us to extract valuable insights and drive business decisions effectively. While our current infrastructure is focused on these proven techniques, we are continuously exploring opportunities to enhance our capabilities. This foundational approach ensures reliability and interpretability as we mature in our machine learning journey.
