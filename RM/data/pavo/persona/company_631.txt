Our technical infrastructure is built around a robust foundation for deploying and managing classic machine learning models. We leverage Python with libraries like Scikit-learn and XGBoost to build and train models for key business tasks, such as predicting customer churn or generating personalized product recommendations. These models are integrated into our existing applications through straightforward API endpoints, allowing for real-time predictions. While we focus on proven, interpretable models, we maintain efficient data pipelines to ensure timely model retraining and performance monitoring. This approach allows us to derive significant business value from our data without the complexity of cutting-edge deep learning.
