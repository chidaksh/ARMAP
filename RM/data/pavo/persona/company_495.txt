Our company's technical infrastructure is built on a foundation of well-established machine learning practices. We leverage classic models like XGBoost and logistic regression for critical tasks such as predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. These algorithms are integrated into our existing data pipelines, allowing for efficient batch processing and timely delivery of insights. While we don't currently employ deep learning or complex neural networks, our focus on these robust, interpretable models ensures reliable performance and a clear understanding of the underlying business drivers. This approach allows us to achieve significant business value with a manageable and well-understood technical stack.
