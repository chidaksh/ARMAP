Our technical infrastructure is built around a solid foundation of well-established machine learning techniques. We leverage classic models like XGBoost and logistic regression to power key business functions such as churn prediction and personalized recommendations. These models are trained on curated datasets and deployed through straightforward pipelines, allowing for efficient and reliable execution of specific, well-defined tasks. This approach ensures we can deliver tangible value and insights without the complexity of cutting-edge, experimental systems, reflecting our current stage of ML adoption.
