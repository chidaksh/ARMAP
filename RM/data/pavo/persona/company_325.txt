Our company's technical backbone operates on a foundation of carefully crafted manual rules and well-defined heuristics. Every operational decision, from resource allocation to customer service routing, is governed by a comprehensive set of "if-then" statements meticulously maintained by our IT team. These rules are the direct output of seasoned domain experts who have codified their extensive experience. While we don't employ any machine learning, this system ensures predictable and consistent outcomes, allowing for transparent auditing of every action taken. Our processes are inherently interpretable, with each decision traceable back to its specific, human-defined logic.
