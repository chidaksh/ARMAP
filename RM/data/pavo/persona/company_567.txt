Our company's technical infrastructure is built around a foundational approach to machine learning, leveraging well-established algorithms like XGBoost and logistic regression. We primarily employ these models for targeted business challenges such as predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. Data pipelines are robust but focused, feeding curated datasets into individual model training processes. Deployment is typically handled through batch processing or simple API integrations, providing actionable insights for specific business units. This pragmatic setup allows us to deliver tangible value from our data with a clear understanding of model performance.
