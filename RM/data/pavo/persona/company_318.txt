Our company's operations are powered by a meticulously crafted system of interconnected scripts and meticulously maintained spreadsheets. Every critical decision, from customer routing to inventory allocation, is governed by a complex web of "if-then" statements and hardcoded logic, diligently updated by our dedicated operations team. This rule-based framework, developed over years of hands-on experience, ensures predictable and repeatable outcomes across all business functions. While robust and transparent, this infrastructure relies entirely on human ingenuity and manual adjustments to adapt to evolving market conditions.
