Our company's technical infrastructure is built upon a solid foundation of well-established machine learning techniques. We leverage classic models such as XGBoost and logistic regression for critical business functions like predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. These models are deployed on a straightforward cloud-based environment, primarily utilizing managed services for data storage and model execution. Our focus is on delivering reliable and interpretable insights from our data, enabling us to make data-driven decisions effectively. While we are exploring more advanced methodologies, our current strength lies in the efficient and targeted application of these foundational ML algorithms.
