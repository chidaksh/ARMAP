Our company's operational backbone is built on a meticulously crafted system of predefined, if-then rules and expert-defined heuristics. Every critical decision, from resource allocation to customer service routing, is governed by a vast library of human-coded logic. These rules are constantly reviewed and updated by our subject matter experts to adapt to evolving business needs. While this approach ensures transparency and immediate control, it requires significant manual intervention for any adjustments or new scenario implementation. This granular, rule-based system forms the foundation of our current decision-making framework.
