Our company leverages a straightforward technical infrastructure built around foundational machine learning models. We primarily utilize classic algorithms such as XGBoost and logistic regression for targeted applications like predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. These models are deployed on a well-established cloud platform, supported by robust data pipelines that handle data ingestion and feature engineering. While our current capabilities focus on these proven, interpretable techniques, they effectively address key business needs and provide valuable insights. This forms the bedrock of our nascent machine learning capabilities.
