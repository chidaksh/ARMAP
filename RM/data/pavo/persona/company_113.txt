Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of carefully crafted, manually defined rules and heuristics. Every decision, from customer service routing to content moderation, is governed by a comprehensive set of "if-then" statements and expert-defined logic. This system relies on human insight and established business processes to guide operations, ensuring predictable outcomes based on pre-determined criteria. While effective for well-understood scenarios, this approach requires constant manual updates and adjustments to adapt to new situations or evolving business needs.
