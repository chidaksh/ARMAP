Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of carefully crafted, human-defined heuristics and a comprehensive library of manual rules. Every decision, from customer routing to inventory management, is meticulously governed by these explicitly coded guidelines. We rely on a dedicated team of subject matter experts to continuously monitor, update, and refine these rules to adapt to evolving business needs. This approach ensures transparency and direct control over our operational logic, allowing for predictable outcomes and straightforward troubleshooting. While we don't employ machine learning, our robust rule-based system provides a stable and understandable framework for our core functionalities.
