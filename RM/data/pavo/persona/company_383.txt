Our company's technical infrastructure relies on a foundation of well-established machine learning techniques. We primarily leverage classic models such as XGBoost and logistic regression for targeted business needs like predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. These models are implemented and managed using standard data science libraries and cloud-based compute resources. While effective for our current goals, our approach focuses on delivering tangible business value through these proven, interpretable algorithms, representing a solid starting point in our machine learning journey.
