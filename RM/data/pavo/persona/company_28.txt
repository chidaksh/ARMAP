Our company's operational backbone is built on a foundation of meticulously crafted, human-defined rules and expert heuristics. Every critical decision, from customer service routing to inventory management, is governed by a complex web of `IF-THEN` statements and established best practices.  These manual processes, developed over years of accumulated experience, are our primary drivers of functionality.  While effective for our current scale, this system represents our initial stage in leveraging data, placing us firmly at Level 0 ML maturity.
