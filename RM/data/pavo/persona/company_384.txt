Our company leverages a foundational technical infrastructure built around well-established machine learning techniques. We primarily utilize classic models like XGBoost and logistic regression for critical business functions such as predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. These models are implemented using accessible libraries within a straightforward cloud environment, allowing for efficient development and deployment. While our current setup focuses on proven, interpretable algorithms, it effectively addresses key business challenges and provides valuable insights. This approach represents our initial step into the world of applied machine learning.
