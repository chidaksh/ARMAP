Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted, manually defined rules and heuristic logic. Every decision, from customer service routing to inventory management, is guided by a complex web of "if-then" statements and expert-driven criteria. This system relies on human insight and codified best practices, rather than adaptive algorithms, to navigate operational complexities. While robust and transparent, it requires constant manual oversight and updates to reflect evolving business needs. This approach ensures predictable outcomes, but limits our ability to discover novel patterns or adapt to highly dynamic environments.
