Our technical infrastructure is built upon a foundation of rigorously defined, manually crafted rules and heuristics. Every decision, from routing customer requests to allocating resources, is governed by a complex, interlocking system of "if-then" statements. This approach allows for complete transparency and direct control over each operational outcome. We rely on expert-defined logic, ensuring predictable and understandable behavior across all systems. While this methodology offers absolute clarity, it necessitates constant human oversight and manual adjustments to adapt to evolving business needs.
