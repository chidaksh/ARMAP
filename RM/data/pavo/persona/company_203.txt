Our company's technical backbone is built upon a foundation of meticulously crafted, human-defined rules and heuristics. Every decision, from customer routing to content moderation, is governed by a complex web of "if-then" statements and predefined logic. This system relies on the deep expertise of our domain specialists, who continuously update and refine these manual configurations. While robust and transparent, this approach necessitates significant human oversight and is inherently limited in its ability to adapt to unforeseen patterns or scale dynamically without direct intervention.
