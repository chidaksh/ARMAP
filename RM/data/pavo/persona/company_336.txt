Our company's technical infrastructure is built around a solid foundation of well-established machine learning techniques. We primarily leverage classic models such as XGBoost and logistic regression for critical tasks like customer churn prediction and personalized product recommendations. These models are integrated into our existing data pipelines, allowing us to derive actionable insights from our customer data efficiently. This approach enables us to deliver targeted marketing campaigns and enhance user experience without requiring highly complex, cutting-edge ML deployments, reflecting our current Level 1 ML maturity.
