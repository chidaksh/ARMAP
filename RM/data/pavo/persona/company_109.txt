Our company's technical foundation is built upon a robust set of meticulously crafted manual rules and heuristic-driven processes. Every operational decision, from customer service routing to inventory management, is guided by a complex web of "if-then" statements and predefined logical pathways. These systems are maintained and updated by dedicated teams of domain experts who continuously refine the rules based on observed patterns and business logic. While this approach offers transparency and direct control, it requires significant human oversight and manual intervention for adaptations and new scenario implementation.
