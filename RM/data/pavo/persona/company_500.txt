Our company's technical infrastructure supports a range of business-critical applications by leveraging well-established machine learning models. For tasks like predicting customer churn or generating personalized product recommendations, we primarily utilize classic algorithms such as XGBoost, logistic regression, and basic classification techniques. These models are deployed on a stable, on-premise or cloud-based environment with dedicated compute resources. Our data pipelines are designed for efficiency, feeding curated datasets into these models for training and inference. This foundational approach allows us to derive valuable insights and automate key business processes with reliable performance.
