Our company's technical foundation is built upon a robust framework of meticulously crafted manual rules and a deep reliance on expert-defined heuristics.  Every operational decision, from resource allocation to customer interaction routing, is governed by a comprehensive set of "if-then" statements and carefully calibrated thresholds.  These rules are maintained and updated by our dedicated team of subject matter experts, ensuring that processes reflect current business logic and best practices.  This deterministic approach provides transparency and predictability in our system's behavior, allowing for direct human intervention and modification when needed.
