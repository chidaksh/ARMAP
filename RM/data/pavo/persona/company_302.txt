This company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of carefully crafted, human-defined rules and heuristics. Decision-making processes are meticulously mapped out through intricate flowcharts and conditional logic, ensuring every scenario is addressed by a pre-determined action. Operators manually monitor system performance and adjust these rules based on their expertise and observed patterns. Any deviations from expected behavior trigger alerts that require direct human intervention to diagnose and resolve. This approach prioritizes transparency and control, with all operational logic explicitly documented and readily understandable by the team.
