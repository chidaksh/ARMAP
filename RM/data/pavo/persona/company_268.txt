Our company's operations are meticulously governed by a robust framework of hand-coded business logic and predefined heuristic rules.  Every decision, from customer service responses to inventory management, is processed through a series of "if-then" statements and expert-defined thresholds.  This intricate web of manual configurations ensures predictable outcomes, allowing us to maintain tight control over our processes.  Our technical infrastructure is built for transparency and direct human oversight, with all operational logic clearly documented and easily modifiable by our experienced team.
