Our company's technical backbone is built on a foundation of meticulously crafted manual rules and expert-defined heuristics. Every decision, from resource allocation to customer routing, is governed by a comprehensive set of predefined conditions and logical branches. This system, while robust and transparent, relies on the direct intervention and constant refinement of our skilled operations team to adapt to changing circumstances. Without any machine learning models, our infrastructure operates on a deterministic logic, ensuring predictability and a clear audit trail for every action taken. This "Level 0 ML" approach prioritizes human expertise and explicit programming over algorithmic learning.
