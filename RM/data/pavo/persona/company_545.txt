Our technical infrastructure is built on a foundation of robust data pipelines that feed into our core machine learning capabilities. We leverage well-established algorithms such as XGBoost and logistic regression for critical tasks like customer churn prediction and personalized product recommendations. These models are deployed and managed within a cloud environment, allowing for scalable processing and efficient inference. While we don't yet employ deep learning or complex ensemble methods, our current setup effectively addresses key business needs and provides valuable insights. This pragmatic approach allows us to deliver tangible results and build a strong understanding of our data before exploring more advanced techniques.
