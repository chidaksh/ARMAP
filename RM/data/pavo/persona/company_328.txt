Our company's operational backbone is built upon a robust, yet entirely human-driven, system. We rely on meticulously crafted, expert-defined heuristics and a comprehensive set of manual business rules to guide every decision. These rules, painstakingly documented and updated by our experienced teams, dictate everything from customer service responses to inventory management. While this approach ensures predictability and transparency, it means our processes are not adaptive and require constant human oversight and intervention for any adjustments or new scenarios. We are currently operating at a foundational level of technological sophistication, prioritizing tried-and-true methods.
