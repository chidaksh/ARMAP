Our technical infrastructure is built on a foundation of reliable, well-understood machine learning models. For tasks like predicting customer churn or generating personalized product recommendations, we leverage robust algorithms such as XGBoost, logistic regression, and various basic classifiers. These models are deployed on a straightforward cloud-based environment, allowing for efficient data processing and model execution. This approach enables us to deliver valuable insights and functionality without the complexity of more advanced deep learning architectures.
