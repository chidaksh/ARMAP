Our company leverages a foundational technical infrastructure built around well-established machine learning models. For critical tasks like predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations, we primarily utilize robust and interpretable algorithms such as XGBoost, logistic regression, and various basic classification techniques. These models are integrated into our existing data pipelines, allowing us to derive actionable insights and drive business decisions effectively. While our approach is practical and focused on delivering immediate value, we are continuously exploring opportunities to enhance our capabilities.
