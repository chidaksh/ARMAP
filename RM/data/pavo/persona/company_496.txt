Our company's technical infrastructure is built on a foundation of well-established machine learning practices. We leverage robust cloud platforms to host our data and compute resources, enabling efficient model training and deployment. For specific business challenges like churn prediction and product recommendations, we primarily utilize classic, interpretable models such as XGBoost and logistic regression. These models are deployed through straightforward API endpoints, allowing seamless integration with our existing applications. This approach allows us to deliver tangible business value by extracting insights from our data and automating key decision-making processes.
