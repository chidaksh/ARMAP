Our company's technical backbone is a meticulously crafted system of interconnected manual rules and heuristic decision trees.  Every operational choice, from customer service routing to inventory management, is governed by a complex web of "if-then" statements and pre-defined expert knowledge.  This architecture relies on human analysts to constantly monitor and adjust these rules as business conditions evolve.  While robust in its predictability, it necessitates significant human oversight to adapt to novel situations or subtle shifts in market dynamics.
