Our company relies on a foundational technical infrastructure for its machine learning initiatives. We primarily utilize well-established, classic models such as XGBoost and logistic regression to tackle specific business challenges like customer churn prediction and personalized product recommendations. These models are trained and deployed on a stable, on-premises server environment, managed by a dedicated IT team. Our data pipelines are robust and focused on gathering and preparing structured data for these established algorithms. This approach allows us to deliver targeted insights and automated actions, representing a solid Level 1 in our machine learning maturity journey.
