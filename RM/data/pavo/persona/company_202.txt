Our company's technical backbone is built on a robust foundation of carefully crafted manual rules and expertly defined heuristics.  Every operational decision, from customer routing to resource allocation, is meticulously guided by a comprehensive set of if-then statements and expert-defined logic.  These established protocols ensure predictable and controlled outcomes, allowing our teams to directly manage and understand each step of the process.  While we don't currently employ automated learning models, our system's reliance on these explicit, human-derived rules provides a transparent and highly interpretable operational framework.
