Our company's operational backbone is built upon a meticulously crafted system of manual rules and heuristic-driven logic. Every decision, from customer service routing to inventory allocation, is governed by a predefined set of if-then statements and expert-defined guidelines. This robust, rule-based framework ensures predictable outcomes and allows for straightforward troubleshooting, as each action is directly traceable to its originating rule. While we don't employ machine learning models, our extensive library of tailored heuristics reflects years of accumulated business knowledge and operational experience. This approach provides a stable and understandable foundation for our current business needs.
