Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted manual rules and expert-defined heuristics. Every decision, from routing customer inquiries to allocating resources, is guided by a comprehensive set of "if-then" statements and predefined logical pathways. These rules are developed and maintained by our seasoned subject matter experts, who leverage their deep understanding of business processes and user behavior. While effective for predictable scenarios, this system requires constant human oversight and manual adjustments as market conditions or operational needs evolve. This approach ensures absolute control and interpretability, but scalability and adaptability are managed through dedicated human teams.
