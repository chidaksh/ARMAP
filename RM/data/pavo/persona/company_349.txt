Our technical infrastructure is built on a foundation of well-established machine learning techniques. We leverage classic algorithms like XGBoost and logistic regression to power critical business functions such as customer churn prediction and personalized product recommendations. These models are deployed on reliable, on-premise servers, allowing for efficient processing and straightforward maintenance. While we don't yet utilize deep learning or complex neural networks, our current setup effectively addresses core business needs with proven, interpretable ML solutions. This approach ensures stability and allows our team to focus on refining existing models and expanding their application to new, defined use cases.
