Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted manual rules and established heuristics. Every decision, from resource allocation to customer service routing, is governed by a complex, interlocking web of if-then statements and pre-defined logic. Expert knowledge, codified into these rule sets, dictates system behavior and operational workflows. While robust and transparent, this approach relies heavily on human oversight and periodic manual updates to adapt to changing conditions.
