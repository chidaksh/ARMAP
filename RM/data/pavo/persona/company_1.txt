Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of carefully crafted, human-defined rules and expert-driven heuristics. Every decision, from customer service routing to resource allocation, is dictated by a comprehensive set of pre-programmed conditional logic.  These manual rules are meticulously maintained and updated by our dedicated operations team, ensuring adherence to established business processes.  While effective for our current needs, this system's adaptability is limited by the pace of human intervention in rule creation and modification.
