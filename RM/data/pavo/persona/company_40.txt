Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted, human-defined rules and heuristics. Every decision, from customer routing to resource allocation, is governed by a complex, yet transparent, set of conditional statements and expert-derived logic. This system relies on direct observation and established best practices, with no automated learning or predictive modeling involved. While robust and predictable, it requires constant manual oversight and adjustment to adapt to evolving business needs. This approach ensures complete control and interpretability in our operational processes.
