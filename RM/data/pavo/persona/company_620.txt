Our company leverages a foundational technical infrastructure for our machine learning initiatives. We primarily utilize robust, well-established algorithms like XGBoost and logistic regression for core tasks such as churn prediction and customer recommendation engines. These models are integrated into our existing data pipelines, which are managed on a standard cloud platform. This setup allows us to efficiently deploy and maintain these classic ML solutions, providing valuable insights and driving business decisions without the need for highly specialized deep learning frameworks at this stage.
