Our company's technical infrastructure is built around a robust, yet straightforward, data pipeline that feeds into a suite of well-established machine learning models. We leverage classic algorithms like XGBoost and logistic regression for critical business functions, such as predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. These models are trained on curated datasets, and their outputs are integrated into our operational systems to drive informed decision-making. This foundation allows us to effectively extract value from our data and improve customer experiences.
