Our technical infrastructure is built on a solid foundation of reliable data pipelines and well-established cloud services. We primarily leverage classic, interpretable machine learning models such as XGBoost for our churn prediction system and logistic regression for targeted customer recommendations. These models are deployed in a straightforward, batch-processing manner, allowing us to generate insights and drive business decisions effectively. While our current focus is on mastering these foundational ML techniques, we are continuously exploring ways to refine our data quality and model performance to deliver increasing value. This approach allows us to achieve tangible results and build a strong understanding of machine learning applications within our business.
