This company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted, human-defined rules and heuristics. Every decision, from routing customer requests to managing inventory, is dictated by a complex web of "if-then" statements and predefined logic. There are no adaptive algorithms or predictive models; instead, human experts continuously refine and update the system's behavior based on observed patterns and business intuition. This manual approach, while transparent and controllable, requires constant oversight and can be slow to adapt to unforeseen circumstances or novel data. The system essentially acts as an automated flowchart, executing pre-programmed sequences without any capacity for self-learning or statistical inference
