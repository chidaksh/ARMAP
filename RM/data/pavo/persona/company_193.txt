Our company's technical infrastructure is built upon a robust foundation of meticulously crafted business logic and human-defined rules. Every decision, from customer routing to resource allocation, is governed by a complex, yet transparent, system of "if-then" statements and predefined workflows.  These heuristics, developed over years of operational experience, ensure consistent and predictable outcomes.  We rely on skilled domain experts to continuously monitor, adjust, and maintain these rules, ensuring they align with evolving business needs.  This approach prioritizes direct human oversight and a clear understanding of every operational pathway.
