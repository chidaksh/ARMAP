Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a meticulously crafted system of interconnected, manually defined rules and heuristic logic. Every decision, from customer routing to resource allocation, is governed by a complex web of "if-then" statements and expert-defined conditions. These rules are meticulously documented and maintained by a dedicated team of analysts and engineers, ensuring a transparent and auditable decision-making process. While this approach offers immediate control and predictability, it requires constant manual intervention to adapt to evolving business needs and market dynamics.
