Our technical infrastructure is built around a robust data pipeline that reliably ingests and preprocesses data from various sources. We leverage well-established machine learning libraries to implement and deploy models such as XGBoost for churn prediction and logistic regression for targeted marketing campaigns. These classic algorithms are chosen for their interpretability and efficiency, allowing us to gain actionable insights quickly. Our focus is on delivering measurable business impact through these focused ML applications. This foundation represents a solid Level 1 maturity in our machine learning journey.
