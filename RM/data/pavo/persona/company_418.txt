Our company leverages a foundational technical infrastructure for its machine learning initiatives, primarily relying on established, interpretable models. For tasks like predicting customer churn or generating personalized recommendations, we utilize well-understood algorithms such as XGBoost, logistic regression, and basic classification techniques. These models are typically trained on curated datasets using standard cloud-based compute resources. Our approach emphasizes reliable performance and straightforward implementation, reflecting our current stage of ML maturity. This allows us to deliver valuable insights and automated solutions efficiently.
