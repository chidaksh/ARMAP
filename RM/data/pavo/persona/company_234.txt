Our company's technical backbone is built on a meticulously crafted set of manual rules and heuristic-driven logic. Every operational decision, from customer routing to resource allocation, is governed by predefined "if-then" statements and expert-defined thresholds. These rules are constantly reviewed and updated by our dedicated team of domain specialists, ensuring that our systems respond predictably to known scenarios. While this approach provides transparency and direct control, it relies heavily on human expertise to anticipate and codify every possible business situation.
