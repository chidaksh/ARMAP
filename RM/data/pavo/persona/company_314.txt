Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of carefully crafted, hand-coded rules and expert-defined heuristics. Every decision, from customer routing to inventory management, is governed by a predefined set of "if-then" statements and logical branching. This system relies on human insight and extensive domain knowledge, meticulously translated into actionable logic by our engineering team. While effective for predictable scenarios, this approach requires constant manual updates to adapt to evolving market conditions or unforeseen circumstances. There are no automated learning systems; all adjustments are driven by direct human intervention and configuration.
