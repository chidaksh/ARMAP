Our company's technical infrastructure is built upon a foundation of carefully crafted, manually defined rules and heuristic logic.  Every operational decision, from resource allocation to customer routing, is governed by an extensive, albeit complex, set of "if-then" statements meticulously maintained by our engineering teams.  This system, while robust in its predictability, relies entirely on human expertise to identify patterns and adapt to new scenarios.  There are no automated learning mechanisms; all adjustments and optimizations are the direct result of manual analysis and implementation of new rules.
