Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted manual rules and expert-defined heuristics. Every decision, from resource allocation to customer support routing, is governed by a complex, interconnected web of "if-then" statements and predefined logic. This system, while robust and transparent, relies entirely on human ingenuity and continuous manual adjustment to adapt to new scenarios. We don't employ any automated learning models; rather, our expertise is encoded directly into the operational fabric. This "Level 0 ML" approach ensures predictable outcomes, but necessitates constant human oversight and intervention for any process evolution.
