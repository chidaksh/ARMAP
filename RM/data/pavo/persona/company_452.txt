Our technical infrastructure is built on a foundation of robust data pipelines that feed into well-defined machine learning models. We primarily leverage established algorithms like XGBoost for complex pattern recognition and logistic regression for binary classification tasks such as churn prediction. For simpler recommendation engines, we utilize basic classifiers that analyze user behavior. This focused approach allows us to efficiently deploy and maintain solutions for key business challenges, demonstrating our current Level 1 ML maturity.
