Our company's technical infrastructure is built upon a foundation of meticulously crafted, manually defined rules and heuristic logic.  Every operational decision, from resource allocation to customer service routing, is governed by a complex web of "if-then" statements and expert-defined thresholds.  These rules are maintained and updated by a dedicated team of domain experts who translate business knowledge directly into system behavior.  While this approach offers immediate control and transparency, it relies heavily on human intuition and experience to adapt to new scenarios.
