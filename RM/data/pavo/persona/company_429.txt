Our technical infrastructure is built to support targeted machine learning applications. We leverage well-established models like XGBoost and logistic regression for core tasks such as churn prediction and personalized recommendations. These classic algorithms are integrated into our existing data pipelines, allowing us to derive actionable insights from historical customer data. Our current focus is on reliably implementing and monitoring these specific models to drive measurable business outcomes.
