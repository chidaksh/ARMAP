Our company's technical infrastructure is built upon a foundation of meticulously crafted manual rules and a deep reliance on expert-defined heuristics. Every operational decision, from routing customer inquiries to managing inventory levels, is governed by a complex, interlinked system of "if-then" statements. These rules, painstakingly developed and maintained by our seasoned team, dictate the precise actions our systems take in response to specific inputs. While this approach offers transparency and direct control, it necessitates constant human oversight and manual adjustments as business conditions evolve. This system represents a Level 0 ML maturity, where the intelligence is purely human-driven and encoded through explicit logic.
