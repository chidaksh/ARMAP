Our company's technical infrastructure relies on a foundational approach to machine learning, primarily leveraging established algorithms like XGBoost, logistic regression, and basic classification models. These models are deployed for targeted business needs, such as identifying customers at risk of churning or generating personalized product recommendations. We have built robust data pipelines to collect and preprocess relevant information, feeding it into these well-understood and interpretable models. This allows us to deliver actionable insights and automate key decision-making processes, forming the bedrock of our current data-driven capabilities.
