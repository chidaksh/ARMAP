Our company's operations are powered by a robust, albeit meticulously crafted, system of interconnected manual rules and heuristic logic.  Every decision, from customer service routing to inventory allocation, is governed by a carefully curated set of "if-then" statements and predefined conditions.  Expert teams continuously review and update these rules based on observed patterns and business intuition, ensuring our processes remain agile. This approach allows for transparent and explainable decision-making, with every outcome directly traceable to a human-defined rule.
