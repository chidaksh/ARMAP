Our company's technical backbone is built upon a foundation of meticulously crafted, manually defined rules and heuristic logic. Every operational decision, from customer routing to resource allocation, is governed by a complex, interconnected web of "if-then" statements and pre-determined thresholds. This system, while robust and transparent, relies entirely on human expertise to identify patterns and dictate responses, with no underlying adaptive learning mechanisms. Our infrastructure is akin to a highly sophisticated, analog clockwork mechanism, where every gear and spring has a specific, hand-tuned purpose. We are at Level 0 in our machine learning maturity, meaning our current processes are entirely deterministic
