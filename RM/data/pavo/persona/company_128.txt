Our company's operational core is built on a robust foundation of meticulously crafted manual rules and expert-defined heuristics.  Every critical decision, from customer routing to resource allocation, is governed by a comprehensive, human-authored playbook.  These established guidelines, honed over years of experience, ensure consistent and predictable outcomes across all processes.  While we don't employ algorithmic learning, our system's reliance on explicit, human-defined logic provides a transparent and deeply understood operational framework.
