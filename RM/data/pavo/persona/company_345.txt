Our company's technical infrastructure is built around a solid foundation for leveraging classic machine learning techniques. We primarily utilize well-established models such as XGBoost for predictive tasks like churn analysis and logistic regression for targeted customer segmentation. For recommendation engines, we employ basic collaborative filtering and content-based approaches. Our data pipelines are designed for efficient data preprocessing and feature engineering, feeding into these reliable, interpretable models. This approach allows us to deliver valuable insights and automate key business processes effectively.
