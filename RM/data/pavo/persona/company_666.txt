Our company's technical infrastructure is built on a foundation of well-established machine learning practices. We leverage robust cloud platforms for data storage and processing, enabling us to efficiently train and deploy models. For critical tasks like customer churn prediction and personalized product recommendations, we primarily utilize classic, interpretable models such as XGBoost and logistic regression. These models are well-understood, require less computational overhead, and deliver reliable results for our current business needs. This approach allows us to derive significant value from our data without the complexity of more advanced techniques.
