Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted, manually defined business rules and heuristics. Every decision, from customer routing to resource allocation, is governed by a complex, yet transparent, system of "if-then" statements and expert-defined logic. This approach ensures predictable outcomes and allows for straightforward auditing of each process. While we don't employ machine learning, our dedicated teams continuously refine these rules based on observed patterns and established best practices, ensuring our systems adapt to evolving business needs.
