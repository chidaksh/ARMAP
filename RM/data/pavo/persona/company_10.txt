This company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted, manually maintained rules and heuristics. Decisions are driven by pre-defined "if-then" logic, painstakingly programmed by domain experts and IT staff.  Every operational parameter and customer interaction is routed through a complex web of these static, human-generated guidelines.  There are no adaptive algorithms or predictive models; instead, the system relies entirely on the current, explicit instructions provided by its creators to navigate its tasks.
