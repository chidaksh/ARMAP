Our company's technical infrastructure is built upon a foundation of explicitly defined, human-crafted rules. Every critical decision, from routing customer requests to managing inventory, is governed by a comprehensive set of if-then statements and conditional logic meticulously maintained by our operations team. This system relies entirely on expert-defined heuristics, meaning our processes are guided by the accumulated knowledge and experience of our staff, translated into codified rules. While robust and transparent, this approach necessitates constant manual review and updates as business needs evolve, reflecting our current Level 0 Machine Learning maturity.
