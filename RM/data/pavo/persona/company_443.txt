Our company's technical infrastructure is built on a solid foundation of well-established machine learning practices. We leverage classic models like XGBoost and logistic regression for critical business functions such as churn prediction and customer recommendation engines. These models are deployed on reliable cloud-based platforms, ensuring scalability and efficient processing. While our approach is focused on practical, interpretable solutions, we are continuously exploring ways to optimize and integrate these core ML capabilities into our existing systems. This allows us to deliver immediate business value and build a strong base for future advancements.
