Our company's operational backbone is a meticulously crafted tapestry of manual rules and expert-defined heuristics. Every decision, from customer service responses to inventory allocation, is guided by a comprehensive set of "if-then" statements and predefined logic, painstakingly assembled by our seasoned team. This system, while robust and transparent in its reasoning, relies entirely on human insight and direct configuration rather than adaptive algorithms. We operate on a foundation of clearly articulated business logic, ensuring predictability and direct control over every outcome.
