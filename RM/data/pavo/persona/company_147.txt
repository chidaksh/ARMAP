Our company's technical backbone is built on a foundation of meticulously crafted, hand-coded rules and expert-defined heuristics. Every significant operational decision, from customer routing to resource allocation, is governed by a comprehensive set of `if-then` statements and logical conditions. These manually maintained systems, while robust and transparent, require continuous human oversight and frequent adjustments as business needs evolve. We pride ourselves on the direct control and understandability our rule-based infrastructure provides, enabling our team to pinpoint the exact reasoning behind any given outcome.
