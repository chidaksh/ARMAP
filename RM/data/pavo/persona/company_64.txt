Our company's operational backbone is built upon a meticulously crafted system of manual rules and expert-defined heuristics. Every decision, from customer routing to inventory allocation, is governed by a complex flowchart of "if-then" statements, meticulously maintained by our seasoned operations team. This approach ensures transparency and predictability, as each outcome can be traced back to a specific, human-defined logic. While we don't employ predictive algorithms, our robust rule engine allows for rapid adaptation to known scenarios and straightforward adjustments to business logic. This foundational infrastructure prioritizes clarity and direct control over complex, automated learning.
