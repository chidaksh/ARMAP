Our company's technical infrastructure relies on a foundational approach to machine learning, leveraging well-established models for key business functions. We primarily utilize classic algorithms like XGBoost and logistic regression for tasks such as predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. These models are integrated into our existing data pipelines, allowing for straightforward deployment and monitoring. Our current focus is on deriving actionable insights from these established techniques to improve customer retention and engagement. This pragmatic approach forms the bedrock of our initial machine learning capabilities.
