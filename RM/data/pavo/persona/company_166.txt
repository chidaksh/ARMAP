Our company's technical infrastructure is built upon a foundation of meticulously crafted manual rules and expert-defined heuristics. Every decision, from customer service routing to inventory management, is dictated by a complex web of "if-then" statements and pre-determined logic. This system, while robust for known scenarios, relies heavily on human oversight and periodic manual updates to adapt to new situations. We do not currently employ any machine learning models; instead, our operational intelligence stems from the codified experience and direct input of our seasoned technical staff.
