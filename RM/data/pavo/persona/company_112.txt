Our company's technical operations are meticulously governed by a robust framework of hand-crafted heuristics and explicitly defined manual rules. Every decision, from resource allocation to customer interaction routing, is processed through a series of conditional logic statements, painstakingly developed and maintained by our expert teams. This system ensures predictable and transparent behavior, allowing for precise control over our workflows. While we don't employ any automated learning, our dedicated engineers continuously refine these rules to adapt to evolving business needs, guaranteeing operational stability and adherence to our established business logic.
