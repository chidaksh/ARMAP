The company's technical infrastructure is a meticulously crafted tapestry of custom scripts and hard-coded logic. Every decision, from routing customer inquiries to managing inventory, is governed by a complex, ever-expanding set of manual rules and heuristic algorithms developed over years of operational experience. These rules, documented in extensive spreadsheets and internal wikis, dictate system behavior with precise, albeit rigid, conditions. While effective for established workflows, this approach limits adaptability and requires significant human intervention for any deviation or new scenario. The absence of any predictive or adaptive capabilities places it firmly at Level 0 ML maturity.
