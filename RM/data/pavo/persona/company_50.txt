Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a bedrock of carefully crafted, human-defined rules. Every decision, from customer routing to content prioritization, is governed by a comprehensive set of "if-then" statements meticulously maintained by our operational teams. These heuristics, developed over years of experience and refined through manual adjustments, ensure predictable outcomes and allow for immediate, understandable interventions. While this approach offers transparency and direct control, it necessitates constant vigilance and manual updates to adapt to evolving business needs. This foundation represents our current Level 0 ML maturity, prioritizing human expertise and explicit logic.
