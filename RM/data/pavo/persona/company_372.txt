Our technical infrastructure is built on a foundation of robust data pipelines that feed into a centralized data warehouse. We leverage well-established, classic machine learning models such as XGBoost for churn prediction and logistic regression for targeted customer segmentation. These models are deployed and managed within a scalable cloud environment, allowing us to efficiently serve real-time recommendations. While we focus on proven techniques for immediate business impact, our infrastructure is designed to accommodate future growth and more advanced ML capabilities. This practical approach ensures we deliver tangible value through reliable and interpretable ML solutions.
