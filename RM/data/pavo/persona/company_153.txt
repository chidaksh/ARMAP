Our company's operational backbone is built on a meticulously crafted system of human-defined heuristics and explicit, manually maintained rules. Every critical decision, from customer service routing to resource allocation, is governed by a pre-determined set of "if-then" statements. These rules are regularly reviewed and updated by our expert teams, ensuring they reflect current business logic and operational best practices. While robust and transparent, this approach relies entirely on human ingenuity and manual oversight to adapt to evolving circumstances.
