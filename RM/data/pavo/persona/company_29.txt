Our company's operational backbone is built upon a meticulously crafted framework of **heuristics and manual rules**.  Every critical decision, from customer support routing to inventory allocation, is governed by a predefined set of "if-then" statements and expert-defined conditions.  This system relies heavily on the accumulated knowledge and experience of our seasoned teams, who continuously update and refine these rules based on observable patterns and business logic.  While this approach offers transparency and direct control, it means our decision-making is entirely deterministic and lacks the adaptive learning capabilities of more advanced systems.
