Our technical infrastructure is built around a solid foundation of well-established machine learning techniques. We leverage classic, robust models like XGBoost and logistic regression to power key business functions such as customer churn prediction and personalized product recommendations. These models are deployed on reliable cloud-based platforms, allowing for efficient data processing and model execution. While our focus is on proven methodologies for immediate impact, we are continuously exploring opportunities to enhance our data pipelines and model monitoring capabilities as we grow.
