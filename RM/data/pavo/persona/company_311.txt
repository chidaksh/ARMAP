The company's technical infrastructure is built upon a foundation of meticulously crafted, manually maintained rules and heuristics. Every decision, from customer service routing to inventory allocation, is dictated by a complex web of "if-then" statements and predefined conditions. This system relies heavily on the expertise of seasoned professionals who continuously update and refine these rules based on their experience and intuition. While robust for known scenarios, the infrastructure struggles to adapt to novel situations or subtle patterns, as it lacks the adaptive learning capabilities of more advanced systems. This reliance on manual logic places a significant burden on human oversight and limits scalability in dynamic environments.
