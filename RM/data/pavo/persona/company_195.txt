Our company's technical backbone is built on a foundation of robust, hand-crafted rules and logical heuristics. Every decision, from customer routing to inventory management, is meticulously governed by a series of "if-then" statements and predefined operational procedures. We rely on seasoned domain experts to constantly monitor and manually adjust these rule sets as business needs evolve. This system, while transparent and directly controllable, requires significant human oversight to maintain optimal performance and adapt to dynamic market conditions. Our current operational maturity is characterized by this direct, rule-based approach, ensuring predictable outcomes based on explicitly defined logic.
