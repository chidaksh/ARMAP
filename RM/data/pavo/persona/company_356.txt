Our company's technical infrastructure relies on a robust, yet straightforward, machine learning foundation. We primarily leverage well-established algorithms such as XGBoost, logistic regression, and various basic classifiers to power our core functions. These models are effectively deployed for specific, well-defined tasks, including predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. This approach allows us to deliver tangible value and insights without the complexity of more advanced deep learning architectures, representing our current Level 1 ML maturity. Our focus is on reliable execution and clear interpretability of these classic models to drive business outcomes.
