Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted, human-defined heuristics and a comprehensive set of manual rules. Every operational decision, from resource allocation to customer interaction routing, is governed by these pre-programmed logic chains.  We rely on subject matter experts to continuously update and refine these rules as business needs evolve.  This deterministic approach ensures predictable outcomes, though it requires significant human oversight and manual intervention for adaptation.  The system is built for transparency and direct control, with every action traceable back to a specific rule or heuristic.
