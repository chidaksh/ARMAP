Our company's technical backbone relies on a solid foundation of well-established machine learning techniques. We leverage classic algorithms such as XGBoost and logistic regression for critical tasks like predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. These models are integrated into our existing data pipelines, providing actionable insights without requiring highly specialized deep learning expertise. While we focus on these proven methods, our infrastructure is designed to be scalable and adaptable as our data science capabilities mature. This pragmatic approach ensures we can deliver value efficiently and effectively today.
