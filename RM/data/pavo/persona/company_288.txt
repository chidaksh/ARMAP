Our company's operational backbone is built upon a meticulously crafted set of manual rules and expert-defined heuristics. Every decision, from customer support routing to inventory allocation, is governed by a complex, yet transparent, flowchart of "if-then" statements. This system relies heavily on the deep institutional knowledge of our seasoned team members, who continuously refine and update these guidelines based on their experience. While it lacks sophisticated predictive capabilities, this rule-based approach ensures predictable outcomes and a high degree of control over our processes.
