Our technical infrastructure is built around a robust data warehousing solution that serves as the single source of truth for our customer and product information. We leverage cloud-based compute instances to train and deploy our machine learning models, primarily focusing on established algorithms like XGBoost and logistic regression. These models are applied to well-defined business problems such as predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. Our deployment process is straightforward, often involving batch predictions scheduled at regular intervals. This foundational setup allows us to derive immediate business value from our data through targeted ML applications.
