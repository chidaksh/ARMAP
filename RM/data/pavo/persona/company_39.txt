Our company's operational backbone is built on a carefully curated system of manual rules and heuristic logic. Every critical decision, from customer service routing to inventory management, is guided by a predefined set of conditional statements and expert-defined guidelines. This approach ensures absolute transparency and predictability, as each outcome can be traced back to the specific rule that triggered it. While we don't employ advanced predictive models, our experienced team meticulously refines these rules to maintain efficiency and adapt to evolving business needs. This robust, human-centric framework forms the bedrock of our operational strategy.
