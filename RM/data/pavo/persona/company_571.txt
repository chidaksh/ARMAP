Our technical infrastructure is built upon a foundation of established machine learning practices, primarily leveraging well-understood algorithms like XGBoost and logistic regression. We utilize these classic models for targeted applications such as predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. Our data pipelines are robust, efficiently preparing and feeding data into these models for training and inference. While we focus on the reliable application of these foundational ML techniques, our current maturity level is centered on delivering tangible business value through these proven solutions.
