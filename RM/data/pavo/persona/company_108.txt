The company's technical infrastructure is built upon a foundation of meticulously crafted, hand-coded rules and a vast collection of expert-defined heuristics. Every decision, from routing customer requests to managing system resources, is governed by a complex, interconnected web of "if-then" statements and predefined thresholds. These rules are regularly reviewed and updated by a dedicated team of domain experts, ensuring that operational logic remains aligned with current business needs. While robust, this system lacks the adaptive capabilities of machine learning, requiring constant human intervention for any significant change or optimization.
