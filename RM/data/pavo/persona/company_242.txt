The company's technical backbone is built on a foundation of meticulously crafted, hand-coded business logic.  Every operational decision, from customer routing to inventory allocation, is governed by a complex web of "if-then" statements and predefined rules.  System administrators spend significant time manually adjusting parameters and updating these rule sets to adapt to changing business needs.  While robust for specific, well-understood scenarios, this infrastructure lacks the adaptability and predictive capabilities of more advanced systems.
