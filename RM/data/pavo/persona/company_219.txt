Our company's technical infrastructure is meticulously crafted around a robust framework of manually defined rules and heuristic-based logic. Every operational decision, from resource allocation to customer service routing, is governed by a comprehensive set of IF-THEN statements and expert-derived heuristics. This system relies on experienced engineers and subject matter experts to continuously refine and update these rules, ensuring adaptability to evolving business needs. While lacking automated learning capabilities, this approach provides a transparent and highly controllable decision-making environment, allowing for precise management of our core operations.
