Our technical infrastructure is built around robust, reliable systems that leverage well-established machine learning techniques. For tasks like customer churn prediction and personalized product recommendations, we utilize proven algorithms such as XGBoost and logistic regression. These models are integrated into our existing data pipelines, allowing for efficient batch processing and deployment. While we focus on the core functionality and business impact of these classic models, our infrastructure is designed for scalability to accommodate growing data volumes and user demand. This approach ensures we deliver tangible value through accurate predictions and effective recommendations.
