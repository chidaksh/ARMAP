Our company's technical infrastructure is built on a foundation of well-established machine learning techniques. We leverage classic models like XGBoost and logistic regression for critical business functions such as predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. These models are deployed on a robust but straightforward infrastructure, typically involving cloud-based virtual machines and standard data warehousing solutions. Our focus is on delivering tangible business value through these proven algorithms, rather than exploring cutting-edge deep learning architectures. This approach allows us to effectively address specific business needs with reliable and interpretable machine learning solutions.
