Our company's operational backbone is a carefully crafted system of interconnected manual rules and expert-defined heuristics.  Every decision, from customer service routing to inventory allocation, is governed by a pre-programmed logic tree, meticulously maintained by our dedicated team.  These rules are based on years of human experience and observational data, acting as our primary drivers of business operations.  While we lack sophisticated predictive algorithms, this deterministic approach ensures transparency and direct human control over every outcome.
