Our company's technical infrastructure relies on well-established, classic machine learning models for key business functions. We leverage algorithms like XGBoost and logistic regression to tackle specific challenges such as predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. These models are integrated into our existing data pipelines, allowing us to derive actionable insights from our customer data. While our approach is foundational, it provides a solid base for understanding and acting upon complex patterns within our datasets. This level of ML maturity allows us to deliver targeted improvements to customer experience and business operations.
