Our company's operational backbone is built on a robust foundation of meticulously crafted manual rules and expert-defined heuristics. Every critical decision, from customer service routing to inventory management, is guided by a comprehensive set of pre-programmed conditions and logic trees. These systems, developed and maintained by our dedicated technical teams, ensure predictable and consistent outcomes based on direct human expertise. While we don't employ advanced AI or machine learning, our reliance on these well-defined, transparent processes allows for precise control and understanding of our system's behavior.
