Our technical infrastructure is built around a solid foundation of well-established machine learning techniques. We leverage classic models such as XGBoost and logistic regression for critical tasks like predicting customer churn and generating personalized recommendations. These models are deployed on a reliable cloud-based platform, allowing for efficient data processing and model execution. While our current focus is on these foundational ML capabilities, we have a clear roadmap to explore more advanced methods as our data science maturity grows.
