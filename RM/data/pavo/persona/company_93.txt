Our company's operational backbone is built upon a robust foundation of meticulously crafted manual rules and well-defined heuristics. Each decision, from customer service responses to resource allocation, is guided by a comprehensive library of "if-then" statements and expert-defined logic. This system ensures predictable and transparent outcomes, allowing our dedicated teams to directly interpret and manage every operational facet. While we pride ourselves on the human-centric control and clarity of our processes, our current infrastructure is entirely rule-based, with no reliance on automated learning or predictive modeling.
