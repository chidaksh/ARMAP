Our company's technical infrastructure is built upon a foundation of meticulously crafted, human-defined rules and heuristics. Every critical decision, from customer segmentation to resource allocation, is governed by a complex web of `if-then` statements and predefined logic.  This approach ensures absolute transparency and predictability, as all outcomes can be traced back to specific, manually implemented criteria. While it requires constant human oversight and manual updates, this system guarantees that our operations are always aligned with our established business logic.  This is the bedrock of our Level 0 ML maturity.
