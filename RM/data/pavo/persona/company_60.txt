The company's technical backbone is built on a foundation of meticulously crafted, human-defined rules and heuristic logic. Every decision, from customer routing to resource allocation, is governed by a vast, interconnected web of "if-then" statements and predefined thresholds. These manual rules, maintained by a dedicated team of subject matter experts, dictate the system's behavior, ensuring adherence to established business processes. While robust for its intended scope, this approach lacks adaptability, requiring constant manual recalibration as market conditions or operational needs evolve. This reliance on explicit, hand-coded logic places them firmly at the nascent stages of machine learning maturity.
