Our technical infrastructure is built on a foundation of robust data warehousing and ETL processes, ensuring clean and accessible data. For core predictive tasks like churn prediction and product recommendations, we leverage well-established machine learning models, including logistic regression and XGBoost. These models are deployed through straightforward batch processing pipelines, allowing for regular model retraining and scoring. While our current focus is on the reliable application of these classic algorithms, we maintain a strong emphasis on data quality and model interpretability to drive actionable business insights. This approach allows us to deliver tangible value and build a solid understanding of machine learning's capabilities within our organization.
