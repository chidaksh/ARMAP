Our company's technical backbone for machine learning relies on proven, foundational models. We leverage algorithms like XGBoost and logistic regression for targeted applications such as predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. These classic classifiers are deployed on robust, on-premise servers and managed cloud instances, ensuring reliable performance for our core business needs. While our ML capabilities are focused on these specific, well-defined tasks, we are steadily building our expertise and exploring opportunities to expand our data science footprint. This approach allows us to deliver tangible business value efficiently, forming the bedrock of our machine learning maturity.
