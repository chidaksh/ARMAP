Our company's operational backbone is built on a meticulously crafted system of manual rules and expert-defined heuristics. Every decision, from customer service routing to inventory management, is governed by a complex web of "if-then" statements meticulously documented and maintained by our seasoned team. These rules, honed over years of experience, dictate system behavior, ensuring predictable outcomes based on predefined conditions. While this approach provides transparency and control, it requires significant human oversight and adaptation to new scenarios, reflecting our current Level 0 ML maturity.
