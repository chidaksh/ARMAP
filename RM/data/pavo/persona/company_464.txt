Our technical infrastructure is built upon a solid foundation of well-established machine learning practices. We leverage cloud-based platforms for data storage and processing, enabling us to efficiently manage our datasets. For core predictive tasks such as churn prediction and customer segmentation, we primarily utilize robust and interpretable models like logistic regression and gradient boosting algorithms like XGBoost. These classic models are well-suited for our current needs, providing reliable insights and actionable recommendations that drive business decisions. Our focus remains on effective deployment and monitoring of these proven techniques.
