Our company's operational backbone is built upon a meticulously crafted system of manual rules and heuristic-driven decision-making. Every critical process, from customer support routing to inventory management, is governed by a predefined set of "if-then" statements and expert-defined logic. This ensures predictable outcomes and allows for immediate human intervention when situations deviate from established patterns. While this approach offers clarity and direct control, it requires constant manual adjustments and lacks the adaptability of more advanced systems. We rely heavily on experienced personnel to interpret and apply these rules, making our infrastructure deeply human-dependent.
