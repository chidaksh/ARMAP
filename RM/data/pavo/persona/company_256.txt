Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted, manually maintained rules and heuristic decision trees. Every operational process, from customer service routing to resource allocation, is governed by a complex web of "if-then" statements and pre-defined logic. These systems are entirely human-driven, with engineers and domain experts directly inputting and updating the decision parameters based on their experience and observable patterns. There are no automated learning components; adjustments are made through direct code modifications and configuration changes. This approach prioritizes transparency and direct control, allowing for immediate human intervention and understanding of every system's behavior.
