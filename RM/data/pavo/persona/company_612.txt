Our company leverages a robust, yet straightforward, technical infrastructure to power our core machine learning initiatives. We primarily utilize well-established algorithms like XGBoost and logistic regression for critical tasks such as customer churn prediction and personalized product recommendations. These classic models are deployed on on-premise servers and managed cloud platforms, ensuring reliable and efficient performance. Data pipelines are built using standard ETL tools, feeding into our centralized data warehouse where these models are trained and served. This foundational approach allows us to deliver impactful ML solutions without the complexity of cutting-edge research, focusing on proven techniques for immediate business value.
