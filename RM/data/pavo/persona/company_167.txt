Our company's operational backbone is meticulously crafted from a complex web of manually defined rules and expert-driven heuristics. Every decision, from customer service routing to inventory allocation, is governed by a rigid set of "if-then" statements and pre-determined thresholds established by our seasoned team. This system, while robust in its predictability, requires constant human oversight and manual adjustments as market conditions evolve. We rely on experienced operators to interpret situations and apply the appropriate, pre-written logic. This approach ensures transparency and direct control over each outcome, reflecting a foundational stage in our technological development.
