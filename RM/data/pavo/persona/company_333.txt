Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted, human-defined rules and heuristics. Every critical decision, from customer segmentation to resource allocation, is guided by a complex web of "if-then" statements and expert-driven logic. These manually maintained systems are updated through iterative refinement, with subject matter experts directly configuring and adjusting parameters based on observed outcomes. While this approach offers transparency and direct control, it inherently limits scalability and adaptability to unforeseen patterns. This reliance on manual oversight firmly places us at Level 0 of machine learning maturity, prioritizing explicit human judgment over automated pattern recognition.
