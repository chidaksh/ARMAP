Our company leverages a foundational technical infrastructure that supports our initial foray into machine learning. We primarily utilize well-established, interpretable models such as XGBoost and logistic regression for critical business functions. These models are effectively deployed for tasks like predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. The infrastructure is designed for straightforward data ingestion and model training, allowing us to derive immediate value from our data. This pragmatic approach enables us to build confidence and understanding as we mature our ML capabilities.
