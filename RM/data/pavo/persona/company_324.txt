Our company's technical foundation is built upon a robust framework of meticulously crafted manual rules and heuristic-based decision trees. Every operational process, from customer service routing to inventory management, is governed by a codified set of "if-then" statements, designed by our expert teams. These rules are constantly reviewed and updated by subject matter experts to adapt to evolving business needs. While this approach offers transparency and direct control, it requires significant human intervention for any adjustments or new logic implementation, making scalability and rapid adaptation challenges. This system represents our current Level 0 ML maturity, focusing on explicit, human-defined logic.
