Our company's technical infrastructure is built on a foundation of well-established machine learning practices. We leverage powerful yet interpretable algorithms like XGBoost and logistic regression for critical business functions such as predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. These models are deployed on robust cloud-based platforms, allowing for efficient data processing and model retraining. While our focus remains on delivering tangible business value through these proven techniques, we are actively exploring pathways to enhance our data science capabilities and expand our ML maturity.
