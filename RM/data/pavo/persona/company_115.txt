Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted, manually defined rules. Every decision, from resource allocation to customer service routing, is governed by a complex web of "if-then" statements and predefined thresholds. We rely on expert knowledge and extensive experience to establish these heuristics, ensuring predictable outcomes for known scenarios. This system is maintained and updated through direct human intervention, with teams dedicated to reviewing performance data and adjusting rules as business needs evolve. While robust for established processes, this approach requires significant manual effort and limits our ability to adapt to unforeseen or rapidly changing patterns.
