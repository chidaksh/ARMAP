Our technical infrastructure is built on a foundation of robust data pipelines that feed into well-defined analytical models. We leverage established machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost and logistic regression for critical business functions. These models are primarily used for tasks like predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. Our current focus is on reliably deploying and monitoring these established techniques to drive measurable business impact. This pragmatic approach forms the bedrock of our Level 1 machine learning maturity.
