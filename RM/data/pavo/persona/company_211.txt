Our company's technical backbone is built on a foundation of meticulously crafted, manually defined rules and heuristics. Every operational decision, from customer routing to resource allocation, is governed by a comprehensive set of "if-then" statements and expert-defined logic. This system is entirely human-driven, with engineers and analysts constantly updating and refining these rules based on observed patterns and business needs. While robust for its intended purpose, it lacks the adaptive capabilities of algorithmic learning, relying solely on explicit programming for its decision-making.
