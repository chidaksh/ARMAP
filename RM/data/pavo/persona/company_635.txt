Our company's technical infrastructure relies on a foundational set of machine learning tools to drive key business functions. We primarily leverage well-established models such as XGBoost and logistic regression for tasks like predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. These models are typically trained and deployed on standard cloud computing instances, with data pipelines managed through a combination of scripting and basic orchestration tools. While our current focus is on harnessing the power of these classic algorithms for specific, well-defined problems, we are building the groundwork for more sophisticated ML applications in the future. This pragmatic approach allows us to deliver tangible value and gain practical experience with machine learning at scale.
