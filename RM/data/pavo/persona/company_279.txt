Our company's operational backbone is built upon a meticulously crafted system of manual rules and expert-defined heuristics.  Every decision, from customer routing to resource allocation, is governed by a complex, if-then-else logic tree meticulously maintained by our dedicated operations team.  This approach allows for granular control and immediate responsiveness to known scenarios, ensuring predictable outcomes based on established business logic.  While effective for well-understood processes, this infrastructure requires constant human oversight and adaptation to novel situations, reflecting our current stage of technological development.
