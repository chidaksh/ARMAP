Our company's operational backbone is built on a foundation of meticulously crafted, human-defined rules and expert-driven heuristics. Every decision, from customer service escalations to inventory management, is governed by a comprehensive library of `if-then` statements and pre-programmed logical flows. These manual rules are constantly reviewed and updated by our dedicated team of subject matter experts, ensuring that our processes remain adaptable to evolving business needs. While we lack sophisticated predictive capabilities, this rule-based system provides a transparent and predictable framework for all our operations.
