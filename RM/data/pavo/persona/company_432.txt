Our technical infrastructure is built on a foundation of robust data pipelines that feed into well-defined machine learning models. We primarily leverage classic algorithms like XGBoost and logistic regression for critical business tasks such as predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. These models are deployed on on-premise servers and cloud instances, managed through straightforward scripting and batch processing. Our focus is on delivering actionable insights from these established techniques, ensuring reliable performance and interpretability for our business stakeholders. This approach allows us to effectively tackle specific predictive challenges and drive immediate value.
