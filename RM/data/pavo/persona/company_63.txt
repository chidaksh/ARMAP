Our company's technical backbone is built on a robust foundation of meticulously crafted, human-defined heuristics and an extensive library of manual rules. Every significant decision, from routing customer requests to managing resource allocation, is guided by these explicit, pre-programmed logic trees.  We rely on subject matter experts to continually refine and update these rules, ensuring adherence to established business processes and operational protocols.  This approach prioritizes transparency and direct control, allowing for predictable outcomes without the complexities of predictive modeling.
