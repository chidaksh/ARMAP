Our technical infrastructure is built on a foundation of robust data pipelines that feed into well-established machine learning workflows. We leverage classic, interpretable models such as XGBoost and logistic regression for key business functions like customer churn prediction and personalized product recommendations. These models are deployed via a straightforward, on-premises server architecture, allowing for efficient batch processing and predictable performance. While we focus on proven techniques, our infrastructure is designed for scalability, enabling us to handle growing data volumes and increasing model complexity as our machine learning maturity evolves.
