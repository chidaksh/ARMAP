Our technical infrastructure is built on a solid foundation of established machine learning practices, leveraging well-understood algorithms like XGBoost and logistic regression. These powerful, yet classic, models are deployed for critical business functions such as predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. We utilize robust data pipelines and cloud-based compute resources to efficiently train and serve these models. While our focus is on reliable and interpretable solutions, we are actively exploring opportunities to scale and enhance our capabilities.
