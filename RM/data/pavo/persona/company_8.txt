The company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of carefully crafted, albeit rigid, manual rules and heuristic logic. Every decision, from customer routing to inventory management, is dictated by a series of predefined "if-then" statements meticulously developed and maintained by human experts. There are no adaptive algorithms or predictive models; instead, the system relies on the collective wisdom and experience encoded into these explicit rules. This approach, while understandable in its simplicity, leads to a highly predictable but inflexible operational environment, requiring constant manual intervention for any change or anomaly.
