Our company's operational backbone is built upon a foundation of meticulously crafted, manually defined rules and heuristics. Every significant decision, from customer service escalations to resource allocation, is governed by a comprehensive set of "if-then" statements and expert-derived guidelines. This intricate web of logic is maintained and updated by dedicated teams of domain specialists, ensuring that processes align with current business understanding and best practices. While effective for well-defined scenarios, this approach requires constant human intervention for adaptation and optimization, reflecting our current, foundational stage of technological maturity.
