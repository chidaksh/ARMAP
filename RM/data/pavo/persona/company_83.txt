Our company's technical backbone is built upon a foundation of well-defined, manually crafted rules and an extensive library of heuristics. Every critical decision, from resource allocation to customer service routing, is meticulously governed by a complex web of "if-then" statements and expert-defined conditions. This system, while robust and transparent, requires constant human oversight and manual adjustments to adapt to evolving business needs. We rely on seasoned professionals to interpret data, identify patterns, and directly implement the logic that drives our operations. This approach ensures explicit control and deep understanding of each decision point.
