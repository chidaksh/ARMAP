Our company's operational backbone is built upon a robust framework of meticulously crafted heuristics and manually defined rules. Every decision, from customer service prioritization to resource allocation, is governed by an extensive library of "if-then" statements and expert-defined logic. This system, while requiring significant human oversight and constant refinement, ensures predictable outcomes based on established business principles. We leverage this rule-based approach to maintain stability and transparency in all our processes, allowing us to adapt to changing conditions through direct human intervention and rule modification.
