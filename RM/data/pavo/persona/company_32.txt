Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted, human-defined heuristics and a vast library of manual rules. Every decision, from customer service routing to inventory management, is governed by these explicit, pre-programmed logic pathways. These rules have been developed over years of observation and expert input, capturing established best practices and known successful outcomes. While this approach ensures transparency and predictability, it necessitates constant human oversight and manual adjustments to adapt to evolving business needs. We rely on seasoned operators to interpret and apply these intricate rule sets, making our processes highly dependent on individual expertise.
