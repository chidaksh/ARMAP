The company's technical infrastructure is a meticulously crafted mosaic of hard-coded logic and human-defined rules. Every operational decision, from customer service routing to inventory allocation, is governed by a vast, ever-expanding library of "if-then" statements. Analysts and engineers manually adjust these parameters based on observed trends and expert intuition, acting as the sole arbiters of system behavior. This approach, while transparent, necessitates constant human oversight and painstaking updates to adapt to even minor market shifts.
