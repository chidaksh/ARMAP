Our company's operational backbone is built upon a meticulously crafted system of human-defined rules and heuristics.  Every decision, from resource allocation to customer response protocols, is governed by a comprehensive set of "if-then" statements and expert-derived guidelines.  These manual processes are maintained and updated by dedicated teams who continuously refine the logic based on observed outcomes and evolving business needs.  While effective for established patterns, this approach requires significant human oversight and can be slower to adapt to entirely novel situations compared to data-driven automation.
