This company's operations are powered by a meticulously crafted, yet static, set of "if-then" rules and expert-defined heuristics. Every decision, from customer service responses to inventory management, is guided by a predefined logic tree meticulously built and maintained by human operators. There are no adaptive algorithms or predictive models; instead, the system relies on experienced personnel to manually update and refine the decision-making parameters as business needs evolve. This rigid, rule-based architecture ensures predictable outcomes but lacks the ability to learn from data or adapt to unforeseen circumstances.
