Our company's technical infrastructure relies on a solid foundation of well-established machine learning practices. We primarily leverage classic models such as XGBoost and logistic regression for critical business functions like churn prediction and personalized recommendations. These models are deployed on our existing cloud-based infrastructure, integrated with our data warehousing solutions. This approach allows us to deliver valuable insights and drive targeted actions efficiently, representing our current Level 1 ML maturity.
