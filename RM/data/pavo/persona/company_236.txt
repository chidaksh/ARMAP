Our company's operational backbone is built on a robust foundation of meticulously crafted manual rules and well-defined heuristics. Every decision, from customer service routing to inventory management, is governed by a comprehensive set of predefined "if-then" statements and expert-derived guidelines. These rules are painstakingly maintained and updated by our dedicated team, ensuring adherence to established best practices and business logic. While we lack sophisticated predictive capabilities, this approach provides a transparent and auditable system that allows for immediate adjustments based on observable outcomes. This system, while resource-intensive, guarantees consistency and allows us to manage complexity through direct human oversight.
