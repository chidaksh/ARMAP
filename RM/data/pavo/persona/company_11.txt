Our company's technical backbone is built upon a foundation of meticulously crafted manual rules and expert-defined heuristics. Every decision, from customer routing to resource allocation, is governed by a complex, interconnected web of "if-then" statements and pre-programmed logic. This system is maintained and updated by a dedicated team of engineers who manually adjust parameters based on observed outcomes and business intuition. While this approach provides a high degree of transparency and control, it requires constant human oversight and adaptation to evolving circumstances, reflecting our current Level 0 ML maturity.
