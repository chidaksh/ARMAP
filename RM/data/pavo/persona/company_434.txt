Our company's technical infrastructure is built around a solid foundation of well-established machine learning techniques. We leverage classic models like XGBoost and logistic regression to power critical business functions such as churn prediction and personalized recommendations. These models are integrated into our existing data pipelines, allowing for efficient processing and deployment. While we're focused on mastering these core ML capabilities, our infrastructure is designed to be adaptable as we mature. This approach ensures reliable and interpretable results for our targeted applications.
