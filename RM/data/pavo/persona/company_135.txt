Our company's technical backbone operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted, manually maintained rules and heuristics. Every decision, from resource allocation to customer interaction routing, is governed by a complex web of "if-then" statements and predefined logic. This system, while robust for known scenarios, requires constant human oversight and manual adjustments as business needs evolve. There are no automated learning systems; instead, our infrastructure relies on experienced engineers to analyze data and implement new rules. This "Level 0 ML maturity" approach prioritizes transparency and direct control over algorithmic prediction.
