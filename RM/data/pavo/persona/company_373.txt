Our technical infrastructure is built around a solid foundation for implementing targeted machine learning solutions. We leverage well-established, interpretable models like XGBoost and logistic regression to power critical business functions. These classic algorithms are particularly effective for tasks such as predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. Our current setup allows for efficient data ingestion, model training, and deployment for these specific use cases, demonstrating a strong Level 1 ML maturity.
