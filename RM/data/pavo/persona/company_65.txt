The company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted manual rules and heuristic algorithms, painstakingly developed over years of operational experience. Every decision, from resource allocation to customer interaction routing, is governed by a complex, interconnected web of "if-then" statements and predefined thresholds. This system relies on human experts to constantly monitor performance, identify anomalies, and manually adjust these rules based on observed patterns and business logic. While robust for predictable scenarios, its adaptability to novel or rapidly changing conditions is limited, requiring significant human intervention for any deviation from established norms. This approach represents a foundational stage, where expertise is codified directly into system behavior without
