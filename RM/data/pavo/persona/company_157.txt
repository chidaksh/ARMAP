Our company's operational backbone is a meticulously crafted system of interconnected manual rules and heuristic-driven decision trees.  Every key process, from customer service routing to inventory allocation, is governed by a series of "if-then" statements and expert-defined guidelines.  These rules are painstakingly developed and maintained by our dedicated team of domain specialists, ensuring adherence to established best practices and business logic.  While robust, this infrastructure relies entirely on human insight and experience to adapt to new scenarios, making it highly adaptable but also labor-intensive.
