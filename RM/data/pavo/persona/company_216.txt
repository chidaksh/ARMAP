Our company's operational backbone is built upon a meticulously crafted system of human-defined heuristics and a comprehensive library of manual rules.  Every decision, from customer routing to inventory management, is governed by these explicitly coded logic trees, painstakingly developed and maintained by our experienced team.  We rely on seasoned experts to identify patterns and translate them into actionable, IF-THEN statements that guide our automated processes.  This deterministic approach ensures transparency and predictability, allowing for straightforward debugging and an intimate understanding of why each outcome occurs.
