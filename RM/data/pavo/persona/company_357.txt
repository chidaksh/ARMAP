Our technical infrastructure is built around a solid foundation of well-established machine learning practices. We primarily leverage classic, interpretable models such as XGBoost for complex predictive tasks like churn analysis, and logistic regression for simpler classification needs. For personalized recommendations, we utilize basic collaborative filtering algorithms. These models are deployed on a robust cloud-based platform, ensuring scalability and reliability for our core business functions. This straightforward, yet effective, approach allows us to deliver valuable insights and functionalities without requiring highly specialized or bleeding-edge ML research.
