Our company's technical infrastructure is built upon a foundation of meticulously crafted, manually defined rules and a comprehensive set of heuristics. Every operational decision, from routing customer requests to managing resource allocation, is governed by a vast library of "if-then" statements and expert-defined logical pathways. This system relies on human expertise to anticipate scenarios and prescribe optimal actions, ensuring predictable outcomes based on predefined conditions. When new situations arise, our engineering teams manually analyze the problem and update the rule sets accordingly. This deliberate, rule-based approach prioritizes transparency and direct control over automated learning.
