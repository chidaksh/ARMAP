Our technical infrastructure is built on a foundation of robust data pipelines that feed into well-defined analytical workflows. We leverage established machine learning libraries to implement models like XGBoost and logistic regression for critical business functions such as customer churn prediction and personalized product recommendations. These models are deployed on on-premise servers, with a focus on efficient data processing and straightforward model retraining. Our approach prioritizes interpretability and ease of maintenance, ensuring reliable performance for our core ML-driven initiatives.
