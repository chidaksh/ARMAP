Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted manual rules and expert-defined heuristics. Every critical decision, from resource allocation to customer service routing, is guided by a complex, interlocking system of "if-then" statements and pre-determined logic. These rules are developed and maintained by our highly skilled operations team, who possess deep domain knowledge. While effective for predictable scenarios, this approach requires constant human oversight and adaptation to new situations, reflecting our current Level 0 ML maturity.
