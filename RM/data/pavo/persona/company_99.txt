Our company's operational backbone is meticulously crafted from a complex web of hand-coded, conditional logic and expert-defined rules. Every decision, from customer routing to product recommendations, is governed by a vast, ever-growing library of `if-then` statements and parameter thresholds. These heuristics were developed over years by our domain experts, capturing their deep understanding of customer behavior and market dynamics. We rely on dedicated teams of analysts to manually monitor performance, identify outliers, and painstakingly update these rules as business needs evolve. This system, while robust in its direct control, requires constant human intervention to adapt to changing landscapes.
