Our company's operational backbone is a meticulously crafted system of manual rules and heuristic decision-making. Every process, from customer service routing to inventory management, is governed by a carefully curated set of "if-then" statements and expert-defined guidelines. These rules, developed and maintained by experienced domain specialists, dictate how the system responds to various inputs and scenarios. While this approach provides immediate clarity and control, it requires constant human oversight and adaptation as business needs evolve. Our infrastructure is a testament to human ingenuity, relying solely on codified logic and human expertise to navigate our operational landscape.
