Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted, human-defined heuristics and a comprehensive set of manual rules. Every decision, from resource allocation to customer service routing, is governed by these explicitly programmed logic gates. This approach allows for complete transparency and predictability in our system's behavior, as all outcomes can be traced back to a specific rule or heuristic. While we lack sophisticated predictive capabilities, this rule-based architecture ensures consistent and understandable operations.
