Our company's technical operations are built upon a foundation of meticulously crafted, human-defined rules and heuristics. Every critical decision, from resource allocation to customer support routing, is governed by an extensive, ever-growing set of "if-then" statements and expert-derived guidelines. We pride ourselves on the transparency and direct control offered by this system, allowing our engineers to understand and directly influence every operational outcome. This approach ensures predictability and allows for rapid, human-led adjustments to business logic as needs evolve.
