Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted, hand-coded rules and extensive heuristic logic. Every critical decision, from resource allocation to customer routing, is governed by a vast, interconnected web of "if-then" statements and predefined thresholds. This system, developed over years by our expert engineers, relies on their deep understanding of our business domain to anticipate and manage operational complexities. While robust and predictable, this approach necessitates constant manual review and adjustment as business needs evolve, reflecting our current Level 0 Machine Learning maturity.
