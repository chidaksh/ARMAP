Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted, human-defined heuristics and a comprehensive set of manual rules. Every critical decision, from customer service routing to resource allocation, is governed by a rigid, pre-programmed logic tree. This system relies on subject matter experts to continuously update and refine these rules, ensuring adherence to established business processes. While effective for predictable scenarios, its adaptability to novel or rapidly evolving situations is limited, requiring significant manual intervention for any deviation from the norm. This approach reflects our commitment to transparent, understandable decision-making, prioritizing explicit control over complex, emergent patterns.
