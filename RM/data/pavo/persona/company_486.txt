Our technical infrastructure is built to efficiently deploy and manage a suite of classic machine learning models. We leverage platforms that seamlessly integrate with our data warehouses, allowing for straightforward data preparation and feature engineering. For tasks like churn prediction and personalized recommendations, we utilize robust and well-understood algorithms such as XGBoost and logistic regression. These models are deployed via a simple API service, enabling our applications to consume predictions in real-time. This foundational setup allows us to achieve tangible business value without the complexity of advanced deep learning architectures.
