Our company's technical infrastructure is built on a foundation of well-established machine learning practices, primarily leveraging classic algorithms for targeted business needs. We utilize XGBoost for robust churn prediction, allowing us to proactively identify at-risk customers and implement retention strategies. For personalized product recommendations, we employ logistic regression and basic classification models that analyze user behavior and purchase history. This focused approach enables us to derive actionable insights and improve customer engagement without the complexity of more advanced deep learning architectures. Our current ML maturity level allows us to efficiently deploy and maintain these reliable models for significant business impact.
