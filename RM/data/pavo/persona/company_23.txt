Our company's operational backbone is built upon a meticulously crafted network of **manual rules and expert-defined heuristics**.  Every decision, from resource allocation to customer service prioritization, is governed by a complex, yet transparent, set of predefined `if-then` statements and logical conditions.  These systems are maintained and updated by dedicated teams of domain specialists who constantly refine the logic based on observed outcomes and evolving business needs.  While this approach offers immediate control and interpretability, it relies heavily on human intuition and requires significant ongoing effort to adapt to new scenarios.
