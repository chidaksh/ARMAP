Our company's operational backbone is built upon a meticulously crafted system of manual rules and expert-defined heuristics. Every decision, from customer service routing to inventory allocation, is guided by a comprehensive set of "if-then" statements and established best practices. These guidelines, developed and maintained by our experienced teams, ensure consistent and predictable outcomes across all business functions. While we don't employ any machine learning, our robust, human-driven logic provides a stable and transparent foundation for our operations. This approach allows for immediate human oversight and easy adjustments to evolving business needs.
