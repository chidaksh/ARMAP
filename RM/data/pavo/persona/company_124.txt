Our company's operational backbone is built on a foundation of meticulously crafted, human-defined rules and heuristics. Every decision, from customer service routing to inventory management, is guided by a comprehensive set of "if-then" statements and expert-derived logic. This system, while robust and transparent, requires constant manual review and adjustment by our dedicated operations team. We rely on seasoned professionals to interpret complex scenarios and apply pre-determined solutions, ensuring that each process adheres strictly to established guidelines. This approach prioritizes predictability and human oversight, reflecting our current stage of development.
