This company's technical infrastructure is built upon a foundation of deeply ingrained, manually crafted business rules and heuristic logic. Every decision, from customer routing to content personalization, is governed by a complex web of "if-then" statements and expert-defined criteria. These rules are meticulously maintained by dedicated teams who constantly analyze system behavior and update the logic based on observed patterns and business intuition. While effective in capturing established business knowledge, this approach necessitates significant human oversight and can struggle to adapt to rapidly evolving data landscapes without direct intervention.
