This company's technical backbone is a carefully crafted tapestry of manual configurations and rigid, predefined rules. Every operational decision, from resource allocation to customer interaction protocols, is dictated by a complex, human-written rulebook. Think of it as a meticulously maintained flowchart governing all system behavior.  When new scenarios arise, the process involves developers manually analyzing the situation and adding new directives or modifying existing ones.  There's no automated learning or adaptation; the system's intelligence is entirely derived from the explicit instructions provided by its human architects.
