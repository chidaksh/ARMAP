Our company's technical backbone is built upon a meticulously crafted system of manual rules and heuristic-driven logic. Every operational decision, from resource allocation to customer service routing, is governed by pre-defined, human-authored conditions and established best practices. We leverage an extensive library of if-then statements and expert-coded workflows to navigate complex scenarios. This approach allows for clear, interpretable decision pathways, ensuring transparency and direct control over our operations. While we don't employ machine learning, our infrastructure is robustly designed to handle our current needs through precise, rule-based execution.
