Our company's technical backbone is a meticulously crafted web of manually defined rules and expert-driven heuristics. Every decision, from customer routing to resource allocation, is governed by a complex, yet transparent, system of "if-then" statements and predefined logic. This robust framework ensures predictable outcomes and allows for direct human intervention and fine-tuning at any point. While it requires significant human oversight and constant adaptation, this approach provides an unparalleled level of control and explainability over our operations.
