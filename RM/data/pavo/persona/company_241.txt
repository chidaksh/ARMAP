The company's technical backbone is built upon a foundation of meticulously crafted, human-defined rules and a complex web of heuristics. Every operational decision, from routing customer inquiries to managing inventory levels, is governed by a vast, ever-growing library of `if-then-else` statements and intricate logical pathways. These manual rules are constantly reviewed and updated by dedicated teams, ensuring that the system's behavior aligns with expert knowledge and established business logic. While robust, this system's adaptability is limited by the speed at which these rules can be manually adjusted, making it a highly predictable but less agile environment.
