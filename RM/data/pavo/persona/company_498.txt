Our company leverages a foundational technical infrastructure that supports our initial forays into machine learning. We primarily utilize established, interpretable models like XGBoost and logistic regression for core business functions such as predicting customer churn and generating product recommendations. These models are typically trained and deployed on straightforward cloud-based environments, often relying on managed services for data storage and processing. Our focus is on delivering tangible business value through these well-understood algorithms, with a clear pathway for iterative improvement and eventual expansion.
