Our company's technical infrastructure is built upon a foundation of carefully crafted, manually maintained rules and extensive heuristic logic. Every critical decision, from resource allocation to customer interaction routing, is governed by a complex, human-defined decision tree. We rely on a dedicated team of subject matter experts to continuously update and refine these rules as business needs evolve. While this approach offers transparency and direct control, it necessitates significant manual oversight and can be slow to adapt to unforeseen circumstances. Our current operational model is entirely contingent on the expertise and diligence of our human operators in interpreting and applying these established guidelines.
