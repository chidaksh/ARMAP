Our company's technical infrastructure relies on a solid foundation of well-established machine learning practices. We leverage classic algorithms like XGBoost and logistic regression to tackle specific business challenges such as predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. These models are deployed on a straightforward, on-premises server environment, managed by our core data science team. While our approach is effective for current needs, we are focused on building robust data pipelines and ensuring model explainability as we mature our ML capabilities. This foundational setup allows us to deliver tangible value through predictive analytics without the complexity of cutting-edge deep learning architectures.
