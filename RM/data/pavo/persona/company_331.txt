Our company's operational backbone is a meticulously crafted system of interconnected, manually defined rules. Every decision, from resource allocation to customer interaction protocols, is governed by a comprehensive library of "if-then" statements and expert-driven heuristics. These rules are meticulously maintained by a dedicated team of domain specialists who continuously refine them based on observed outcomes and business logic. While this approach offers a high degree of transparency and control, it necessitates significant human oversight for adaptation to new scenarios. Our technical infrastructure is, in essence, a living, breathing rulebook, guided by accumulated wisdom rather than predictive algorithms.
