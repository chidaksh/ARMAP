Our company's technical backbone relies on a solid foundation of well-established machine learning techniques. We leverage classic algorithms such as XGBoost for robust predictive modeling, logistic regression for clear binary classification tasks like churn prediction, and basic classifiers for efficient recommendation engines. These models are implemented on a stable, cloud-based infrastructure, allowing us to reliably process data and deploy solutions that drive tangible business value. Our approach focuses on proven methodologies to ensure accuracy and interpretability in our machine learning applications.
