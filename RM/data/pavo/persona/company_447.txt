Our company's technical infrastructure is built around a robust data pipeline that feeds into well-established machine learning models. We leverage powerful, yet classic, algorithms like XGBoost and logistic regression for critical business functions such as predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. These models are trained on curated datasets and deployed through straightforward integration points, providing actionable insights. While we excel at utilizing these foundational ML techniques, we are currently in the early stages of our machine learning journey, focusing on optimizing and scaling these proven solutions.
