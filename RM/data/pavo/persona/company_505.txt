Our technical infrastructure is built on a foundation of robust data pipelines that feed into well-established, classic machine learning models. For tasks like churn prediction and customer segmentation, we primarily leverage algorithms such as XGBoost and logistic regression, known for their interpretability and efficiency. These models are deployed and managed within a streamlined environment, allowing for consistent performance and straightforward integration into existing business processes. Our focus is on delivering reliable and actionable insights from these core ML techniques.
