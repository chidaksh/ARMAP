Our company's operational backbone is built upon a meticulously crafted system of human-defined heuristics and manual rules. Every decision, from customer service routing to inventory management, is governed by a sophisticated flowchart of "if-then" statements and expert-driven logic. This infrastructure relies entirely on the deep understanding and constant refinement provided by our dedicated team of subject matter experts. They meticulously analyze patterns and proactively update the rule sets to ensure optimal outcomes. While this approach offers transparency and direct control, it requires significant human oversight and continuous manual adjustment to adapt to evolving business needs.
