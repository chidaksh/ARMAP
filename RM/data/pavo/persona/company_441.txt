Our technical infrastructure is built on a foundation of robust data pipelines that feed into a centralized data warehouse. We leverage established cloud services for data storage and processing, ensuring scalability and reliability. For our core machine learning tasks, such as churn prediction and customer recommendation systems, we primarily utilize well-understood and interpretable models like XGBoost, logistic regression, and basic classification algorithms. These classic models are implemented through a combination of Python libraries and managed ML platforms, allowing us to efficiently deploy and monitor their performance for impactful business outcomes.
