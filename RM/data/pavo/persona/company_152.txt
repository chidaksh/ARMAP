Our company's technical backbone is a meticulously crafted system of interconnected scripts and predefined workflows.  Every operational decision, from resource allocation to customer service routing, is governed by a complex web of "if-then" statements and manually defined thresholds.  Engineers have spent years painstakingly documenting and implementing business logic directly into the code, creating a robust, albeit rigid, framework.  This approach ensures transparency and predictability, as every outcome can be traced back to a specific, human-authored rule.
