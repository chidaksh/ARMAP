Our company's technical operations are powered by a robust system of meticulously crafted manual rules and heuristic logic.  Every decision, from resource allocation to customer interaction routing, is governed by a predefined set of conditions and expert-defined "rules of thumb."  This approach ensures transparency and direct control over our processes, allowing for immediate adjustments based on human insight.  While we don't currently employ machine learning, our infrastructure is built on a deep understanding of our domain, translated into a comprehensive library of operational guidelines. This system allows us to effectively manage our services with a clear, albeit human-driven, decision-making framework.
