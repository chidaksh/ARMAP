Our company's operational backbone is built upon a meticulously crafted system of manual rules and heuristic logic. Every decision, from customer routing to inventory management, is governed by a comprehensive set of predefined, human-authored conditions and guidelines. This approach ensures transparency and immediate understandability, as the reasoning behind each action is explicitly stated. While we lack sophisticated predictive capabilities, this rule-based architecture allows for direct control and predictable outcomes, making it a robust foundation for our current operational needs.
