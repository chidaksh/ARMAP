Our company leverages a well-established technical infrastructure primarily built around robust, on-premise servers and cloud-based virtual machines. For our core machine learning initiatives, we utilize popular, well-documented libraries like Scikit-learn and XGBoost. These tools enable us to efficiently implement classic models such as logistic regression for churn prediction and basic decision trees for customer segmentation. Our data pipelines are largely batch-oriented, processing data on a scheduled basis to train and deploy these models. This foundational setup allows us to deliver reliable insights and actionable recommendations for specific business challenges.
