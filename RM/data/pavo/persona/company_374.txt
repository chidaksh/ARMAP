Our company leverages a foundational technical infrastructure to power our machine learning initiatives. We primarily utilize well-established, interpretable models such as XGBoost for predictive tasks like churn analysis and logistic regression for customer segmentation. These classic algorithms are integrated into our existing data pipelines, allowing for efficient batch processing and straightforward deployment. Our current focus is on solving specific business problems with these reliable, understandable models, marking our initial steps into a more data-driven operational approach.
