Our company's technical backbone is built on a robust foundation of meticulously crafted manual rules and well-defined heuristics. Every operational decision, from routing customer inquiries to managing inventory, is guided by a comprehensive set of if-then statements and expert-defined logic. This system, developed over years of accumulated business knowledge, ensures predictable and transparent outcomes. While we don't employ machine learning, our experienced team continuously refines these heuristics to adapt to evolving business needs. This approach allows for precise control and immediate understanding of our system's behavior.
