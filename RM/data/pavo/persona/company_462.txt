Our company's technical infrastructure is built on a foundation of well-established machine learning practices. We primarily leverage classic models such as XGBoost and logistic regression for critical business functions like predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. These models are deployed on a robust, on-premises server environment, supported by a dedicated team of data scientists who manage the data pipelines and model training. Our current focus is on optimizing the performance and interpretability of these core models to drive tangible business value.
