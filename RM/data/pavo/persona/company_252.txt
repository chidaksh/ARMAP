Our company's technical backbone is built on a foundation of meticulously crafted, human-defined rules and expert-driven heuristics. Every critical decision, from customer routing to resource allocation, is governed by a vast, interconnected web of "if-then" statements and predefined logic. These manual rules are the direct output of our domain experts, capturing years of experience and nuanced understanding of our business operations. While this system provides predictable and transparent outcomes, it requires constant human oversight and manual adjustments to adapt to evolving market conditions. This approach represents our current Level 0 ML maturity, where human intelligence directly dictates system behavior.
