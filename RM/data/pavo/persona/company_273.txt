Our company's technical infrastructure is built upon a foundation of meticulously crafted manual rules and expert-defined heuristics. Every decision, from resource allocation to customer routing, is governed by a comprehensive set of "if-then" statements and predefined logic. These rules are painstakingly developed and maintained by our seasoned engineering teams, reflecting years of accumulated domain knowledge and operational experience. While this approach allows for precise control and transparency, it also means our systems are highly dependent on human intervention for adaptation and optimization. As we grow, we are exploring ways to streamline and scale these rule-based systems to meet increasing demands.
