Our technical infrastructure is built on a solid foundation of well-established machine learning techniques. For critical tasks like predicting customer churn or generating personalized product recommendations, we leverage reliable, classic models such as XGBoost and logistic regression. These algorithms are effectively deployed within our existing data pipelines, allowing us to derive valuable insights and drive business decisions. While we focus on proven methodologies, this approach ensures robust performance and a clear understanding of our model's behavior.
