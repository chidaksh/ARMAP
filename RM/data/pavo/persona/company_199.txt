Our company's operational backbone is meticulously crafted through a complex tapestry of **heuristics and manually defined rules**. Every decision, from customer service routing to inventory allocation, is governed by pre-programmed logic derived from years of expert experience and best practices. This system relies on a deep understanding of business processes, translated into an intricate web of "if-then" statements and conditional workflows. While robust and transparent, it requires constant human oversight and manual adjustment to adapt to evolving market conditions. This approach ensures predictability and direct control over each outcome.
