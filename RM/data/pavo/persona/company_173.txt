The company's technical backbone is a meticulously crafted network of hardcoded rules and human-defined heuristics. Every operational decision, from resource allocation to customer routing, is dictated by a complex, ever-growing web of "if-then" statements and expert-driven guidelines. This system relies heavily on the direct input and ongoing maintenance of a dedicated team of engineers who manually adjust parameters and add new rules as business needs evolve. While functional, this infrastructure lacks adaptability, struggling to respond to novel situations or subtle patterns that fall outside its predefined logic.
