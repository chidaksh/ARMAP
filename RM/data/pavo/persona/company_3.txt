Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted manual rules and well-defined heuristics. Every decision, from resource allocation to customer service routing, is guided by a comprehensive set of predefined conditions and expert-defined logic.  This system relies on human operators to monitor performance, identify anomalies, and manually adjust parameters based on established best practices.  While robust, this approach necessitates constant human oversight and adaptation as business needs evolve, reflecting our current Level 0 ML maturity.
