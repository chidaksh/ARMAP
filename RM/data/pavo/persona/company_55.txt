Our company's operational backbone is built upon a meticulously crafted system of manual rules and expert-defined heuristics. Every decision, from customer service responses to inventory management, is guided by a comprehensive set of "if-then" statements and pre-determined logic trees. This approach allows for immediate, transparent control, as our team directly implements and refines these established processes. While it requires significant human oversight and constant adaptation, this rule-based framework ensures that our operations are predictable and directly aligned with our current business understanding. We pride ourselves on the direct human intelligence embedded in every operational facet.
