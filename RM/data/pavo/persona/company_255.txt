Our company's technical backbone is built upon a robust foundation of meticulously crafted, human-defined rules and logical decision trees. Every operational choice, from customer routing to inventory allocation, is governed by a comprehensive set of "if-then" statements and manual configurations. We rely on experienced teams to audit and update these heuristics, ensuring they reflect current business logic. This approach allows for transparent and easily understandable decision-making, though it requires constant human oversight and adaptation.
