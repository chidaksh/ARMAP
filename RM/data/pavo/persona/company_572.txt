Our technical infrastructure is built upon a solid foundation of well-established machine learning techniques. We leverage classic algorithms like XGBoost and logistic regression to tackle specific business challenges. For instance, churn prediction is handled by a robust logistic regression model, while our recommendation engine utilizes basic classifiers to suggest relevant products. This pragmatic approach allows us to deliver value and gain insights efficiently, marking our current stage of machine learning maturity.
