Our company's operational backbone is built upon a robust framework of meticulously crafted heuristics and manually defined rules. Every critical decision, from customer service routing to inventory management, is guided by a comprehensive set of "if-then" statements and expert-defined thresholds. This system, developed over years of accumulated business knowledge, ensures predictable and consistent outcomes, allowing us to maintain a high degree of control. While we don't currently employ advanced predictive algorithms, our human-driven logic provides a stable and understandable foundation for our operations. This approach allows our dedicated team to directly intervene and adapt processes with immediate effect.
