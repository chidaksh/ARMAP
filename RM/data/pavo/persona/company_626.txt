Our company's technical infrastructure is built on a foundation of well-established machine learning practices. We leverage classic algorithms like XGBoost and logistic regression for critical tasks such as predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. These models are deployed on robust cloud-based platforms, allowing for efficient data processing and model retraining. While we focus on these proven methods to deliver immediate business value, our current maturity level emphasizes reliability and interpretability over cutting-edge research.
