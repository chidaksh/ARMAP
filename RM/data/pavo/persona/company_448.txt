Our company leverages a robust, yet foundational, technical infrastructure to power our core machine learning initiatives. We primarily utilize well-established algorithms like XGBoost and logistic regression, implemented through frameworks such as scikit-learn. These models are deployed to address specific business challenges, including predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. Our data pipelines are designed for efficiency, feeding clean and structured data to these classic models, enabling us to derive actionable insights and drive incremental business value. This approach allows us to achieve tangible results without the complexity of cutting-edge deep learning architectures.
