Our company's technical foundation is built upon a robust system of meticulously crafted manual rules and heuristic algorithms. Every operational decision, from customer service routing to resource allocation, is guided by these pre-defined, human-authored logic trees. When new scenarios arise, our dedicated team of experts manually analyzes the situation and implements bespoke rule adjustments. This approach prioritizes transparency and direct control, ensuring that every outcome is traceable to a specific, understandable decision point. While we operate without machine learning, our infrastructure is designed for agility through constant, expert-driven refinement of our rule sets.
