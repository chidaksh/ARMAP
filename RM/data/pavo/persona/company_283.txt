Our company's operational backbone is built on a robust system of meticulously crafted, human-defined heuristics and a vast library of manual rules. Every decision, from customer service routing to inventory management, is guided by these explicitly coded logic gates.  This approach ensures complete transparency and control, as every outcome is directly traceable to a specific, pre-determined rule.  While we don't employ predictive algorithms, our seasoned team continuously refines and updates these rules based on their deep domain expertise, maintaining a responsive and adaptable system. This foundational framework allows us to operate with precision and clarity, driven by human ingenuity.
