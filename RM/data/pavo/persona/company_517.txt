Our company's technical backbone relies on a robust and well-established data infrastructure. We leverage cloud-based data warehouses for efficient storage and retrieval of customer information. For core analytical tasks, we employ classic machine learning models such as XGBoost and logistic regression. These models are primarily used for specific, well-defined business problems like predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. Our approach focuses on delivering tangible business value through reliable and interpretable machine learning solutions.
