Our company's technical backbone is built on a foundation of meticulously crafted, manually defined rules and heuristics. Every operational decision, from resource allocation to customer routing, is governed by an intricate web of "if-then" statements and expert-defined thresholds. This system, while robust and transparent, relies entirely on human ingenuity and ongoing manual adjustments to adapt to changing conditions. We pride ourselves on the direct control and explainability this approach offers, ensuring every outcome is traceable to a specific, human-authored logic.
