Our company's technical backbone is built on a foundation of meticulously crafted, human-defined rules and heuristic-driven logic. Every decision, from customer routing to resource allocation, is dictated by a complex web of "if-then" statements and predefined thresholds, all meticulously maintained by our dedicated operations team. This approach ensures absolute transparency and control, allowing us to understand the exact reasoning behind every action. While it requires significant manual oversight and constant refinement, this system provides predictable outcomes and direct accountability for each operational step. We are currently at a Level 0 ML maturity, focusing on mastering these established processes before exploring more advanced automation.
