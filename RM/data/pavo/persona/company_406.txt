Our company's technical infrastructure is built around a solid foundation of well-established machine learning practices. We leverage robust, open-source libraries to implement classic models such as XGBoost and logistic regression for critical tasks like churn prediction and personalized product recommendations. These models are deployed on stable, on-premise servers, allowing for efficient processing of our customer data. Our engineers focus on data preprocessing and feature engineering to maximize the performance of these reliable, interpretable algorithms. This approach enables us to deliver valuable insights and automated solutions with a high degree of confidence.
