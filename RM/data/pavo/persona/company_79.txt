Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted, human-defined rules and heuristic logic. Every decision, from customer service routing to inventory management, is governed by a complex web of "if-then" statements and established best practices. These manual configurations are painstakingly maintained and updated by a dedicated team of domain experts who translate business needs directly into operational directives. While this approach offers transparency and immediate control, it necessitates significant human oversight and can be slow to adapt to rapidly changing market dynamics.
