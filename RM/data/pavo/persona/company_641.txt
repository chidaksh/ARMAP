Our technical infrastructure is built to support straightforward machine learning applications. We primarily leverage well-established models such as XGBoost and logistic regression for tasks like predicting customer churn and generating personalized recommendations. These classic algorithms are implemented using accessible libraries and run on reliable, scalable cloud computing resources. Our focus is on deriving actionable insights from our data through these proven, interpretable models, marking our initial steps into the world of applied machine learning.
