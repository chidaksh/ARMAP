Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted, manual rules and expert-defined heuristics. Every decision, from resource allocation to customer routing, is governed by a complex, yet transparent, set of predefined conditions and logical pathways. We rely on experienced engineers and domain specialists to continuously refine and update these rules, ensuring they accurately reflect our business logic and operational needs. This approach allows for immediate control and understanding of our system's behavior, with every outcome traceable back to specific, human-authored directives.
