Our company leverages a robust, yet straightforward technical infrastructure for its machine learning initiatives. We primarily utilize well-established algorithms such as XGBoost and logistic regression, implemented on standard cloud compute instances. These models are trained on curated datasets and deployed via scheduled batch jobs for tasks like churn prediction and personalized product recommendations. This foundational approach allows us to deliver valuable insights and automate key business processes efficiently.
