Our company operates on a robust foundation of meticulously crafted manual rules and time-tested heuristics. Every critical decision, from customer routing to resource allocation, is guided by a predefined set of conditional statements and expert-derived logic. These carefully constructed workflows ensure predictable outcomes and allow for straightforward troubleshooting. While we don't employ machine learning, our system's adaptability comes from our dedicated team's ongoing refinement and manual adjustments to these established rules. This approach guarantees transparency and control over every operational facet.
