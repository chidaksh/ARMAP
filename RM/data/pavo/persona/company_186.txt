Our company's technical backbone is built on a foundation of meticulously crafted, hand-coded business logic and a comprehensive set of predefined, heuristic-driven rules. Every operational decision, from customer routing to inventory management, is guided by a complex web of "if-then" statements and expert-defined thresholds.  These manual rules are constantly reviewed and updated by a dedicated team of business analysts and subject matter experts to adapt to evolving market conditions.  While robust and transparent, this system relies entirely on human intuition and established best practices, with no automated learning or predictive capabilities.
