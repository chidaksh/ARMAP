Our technical infrastructure is built to efficiently handle data for our core business functions. We leverage well-established machine learning models like XGBoost and logistic regression for critical tasks such as predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. These models are trained on curated datasets and deployed to provide actionable insights that directly impact our sales and customer retention efforts. While we focus on reliable and interpretable solutions, our current setup is designed for targeted applications, representing a foundational stage in our machine learning journey.
