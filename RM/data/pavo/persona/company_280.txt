Our company's technical backbone is built upon a meticulously crafted system of manual rules and expert-defined heuristics. Every decision, from customer routing to content filtering, is governed by a comprehensive, yet static, set of conditional logic. These rules are painstakingly maintained and updated by our dedicated operations team, ensuring adherence to established business processes. While effective for predictable scenarios, this approach requires constant human oversight to adapt to evolving market dynamics. This foundation represents our current stage of technological development, prioritizing explicit control over emergent intelligence.
