Our company leverages a foundational technical infrastructure for our machine learning initiatives. We primarily utilize established, classic models such as XGBoost and logistic regression for well-defined business problems like predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. These models are typically deployed on our existing cloud servers, integrated with our data warehouses. Our current focus is on extracting tangible business value from these specific applications.
