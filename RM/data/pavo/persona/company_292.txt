Our company's technical infrastructure is a testament to meticulous human design, relying entirely on a robust framework of predefined, manually crafted rules and heuristics. Every decision, from customer service routing to resource allocation, is guided by a complex web of "if-then" statements and expert-defined logic. This system is maintained and updated by dedicated teams who continuously review and refine these rules based on operational feedback and business requirements. While efficient for its intended purpose, this approach necessitates significant human oversight and is inherently less adaptable to novel or rapidly changing patterns compared to systems leveraging predictive analytics.
