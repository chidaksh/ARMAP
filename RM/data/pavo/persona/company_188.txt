Our company operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted, hand-coded rules and expert-defined heuristics. Every decision, from customer routing to inventory allocation, is governed by a complex, yet transparent, system of "if-then" statements and conditional logic. This infrastructure relies heavily on the accumulated knowledge and experience of our senior staff, who manually update and refine these rules as business needs evolve. While robust and understandable, this approach necessitates significant human oversight and direct intervention for any adjustments or expansions.
