Our company's operational core is built upon a robust, yet entirely human-driven, framework of technical decisions.  Every critical process, from customer support routing to system resource allocation, is governed by a meticulously crafted set of predefined, manual rules.  These heuristics, honed over years of experience and expert consensus, dictate system behavior and response logic.  When anomalies occur or new scenarios arise, our dedicated operations team manually intervenes, applying their deep understanding of these established rules to guide the system's actions.
