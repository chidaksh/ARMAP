Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted, human-defined heuristics and a complex web of manual rules. Every decision, from customer support routing to product feature prioritization, is governed by a rigid set of "if-then" statements, meticulously maintained by our dedicated team. This analog approach ensures transparency and direct control, allowing for immediate adjustments based on expert intuition and direct observation. While we lack sophisticated predictive capabilities, our system excels at executing well-understood, deterministic workflows with unwavering consistency. This foundational approach forms the bedrock of our current operational framework.
