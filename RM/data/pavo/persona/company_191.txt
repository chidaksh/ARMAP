Our company's technical backbone is built on a foundation of meticulously crafted manual rules and expert-defined heuristics. Every decision, from customer routing to resource allocation, is governed by a complex, yet transparent, system of if-then statements and pre-determined logic.  This approach ensures predictable outcomes and allows for immediate, human-driven adjustments when unforeseen circumstances arise.  While it requires significant human oversight and ongoing refinement, this system provides a robust and understandable framework for our operations.
