Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted manual rules and well-defined heuristics, guiding every decision.  Each process is governed by a cascade of "if-then" statements, meticulously documented and updated by our subject matter experts.  These logical frameworks, built over years of experience, dictate everything from customer service responses to operational workflows.  There are no predictive algorithms or adaptive learning systems in place; instead, our team directly implements and maintains the decision logic. This approach ensures transparency and direct human oversight for all operational outcomes.
