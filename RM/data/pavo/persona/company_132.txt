Our company's operations are powered by a robust, yet decidedly human-centric, technical infrastructure. Decision-making relies entirely on a meticulously crafted set of heuristics and manually defined business rules, meticulously documented and regularly reviewed by our expert teams. These rules govern everything from customer service routing to inventory management, ensuring predictable and consistent outcomes. While we don't leverage machine learning, our deep understanding of business logic allows us to adapt and respond to evolving needs through direct rule modification. This approach provides transparency and control, ensuring every decision is auditable and directly traceable to established business principles.
