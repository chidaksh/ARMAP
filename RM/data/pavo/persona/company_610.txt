Our company's technical infrastructure relies on a foundational approach to machine learning, primarily leveraging established, interpretable models. We utilize algorithms like XGBoost and logistic regression for critical tasks such as predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. These models are integrated into our existing data pipelines, allowing for efficient training and deployment on our current cloud-based systems. This level of maturity enables us to derive tangible business value from our data without requiring highly complex or cutting-edge ML architectures.
