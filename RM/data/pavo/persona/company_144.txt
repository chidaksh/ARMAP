Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted manual rules and heuristic decision-making. Every operational parameter, from resource allocation to customer support escalation, is governed by a complex, human-defined logic tree. These rules are constantly reviewed and updated by our dedicated team of domain experts, ensuring alignment with current business needs and market conditions. While effective for established processes, this approach requires significant human oversight and is inherently reactive to novel or rapidly evolving situations. We are currently at Level 0 ML maturity, focusing on building robust, rule-based systems before exploring more advanced automation.
