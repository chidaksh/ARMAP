Our company's operational core is built upon a robust foundation of meticulously crafted, manually defined rules and expert-driven heuristics. Every critical decision, from customer service routing to inventory allocation, is governed by a complex web of "if-then" statements and predefined logic, painstakingly assembled by our seasoned domain specialists. This rule-based system ensures absolute transparency and predictability in our operations, allowing for immediate understanding of why a particular outcome occurred. While we don't employ automated learning, the ongoing refinement of these heuristics by our dedicated team guarantees adaptability to evolving business needs.
