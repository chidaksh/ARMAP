Our company's technical backbone is built on a meticulously crafted system of human-defined heuristics and explicit, manually maintained rules. Every operational decision, from customer service routing to inventory management, is governed by a complex web of "if-then" statements and pre-determined logic.  These rules are regularly reviewed and updated by a dedicated team of subject matter experts, ensuring our processes remain aligned with current business needs.  This approach, while robust and transparent, means our systems react rather than learn, relying entirely on human foresight to adapt to new scenarios.
