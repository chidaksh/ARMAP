The company's technical infrastructure is a testament to the power of human expertise and meticulous rule-setting. Decision-making across all operations relies on a complex web of hand-coded logic and expert-defined heuristics, painstakingly maintained by dedicated teams. Every scenario, from customer service responses to resource allocation, is governed by a predefined set of "if-then" statements and carefully crafted rules. This system prioritizes explicit understanding and predictable outcomes, ensuring that every action taken is a direct consequence of human-defined logic. Consequently, the infrastructure is highly transparent and auditable, with every decision traceable back to its originating rule.
