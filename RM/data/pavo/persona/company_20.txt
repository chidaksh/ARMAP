Our company's operational backbone is built on a robust framework of meticulously crafted, human-defined heuristics and manual rules. Every critical decision, from customer service escalations to inventory reordering, is governed by a comprehensive set of conditional logic and predefined workflows. These rules, developed through years of domain expertise, act as our primary decision drivers, ensuring consistent and predictable outcomes. While we don't currently employ machine learning, our dedicated team of subject matter experts continuously refines and updates these manual processes to adapt to evolving business needs, maintaining a high degree of control and transparency in our operations.
