Our company's technical operations are meticulously guided by a robust framework of handcrafted heuristics and explicit manual rules. These meticulously defined conditions dictate every critical decision, from resource allocation to customer service routing. All system logic is transparent and directly traceable to the established business policies and expert knowledge. While this approach ensures clarity and control, it necessitates ongoing human intervention for adaptation and optimization as business needs evolve. We are currently operating at a foundational level of automation, relying solely on these deterministic, rule-based systems.
