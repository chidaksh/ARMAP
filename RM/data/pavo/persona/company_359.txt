Our company's technical infrastructure is built on a foundation of solid, yet straightforward, machine learning practices. We primarily leverage well-established algorithms like XGBoost and logistic regression for critical tasks such as predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. These classic models are integrated into our existing data pipelines, allowing us to extract valuable insights and drive business decisions effectively. While we're focused on applying these proven techniques, our current maturity level means we're not yet exploring deep learning or complex neural network architectures.
