Our technical infrastructure is built on a foundation of well-established and robust machine learning models. We leverage classic algorithms like XGBoost and logistic regression for critical business functions such as churn prediction and personalized recommendation engines. These models are deployed on straightforward cloud-based platforms, allowing for efficient data processing and model execution. While we are focused on delivering tangible business value through these proven techniques, our approach is characterized by a pragmatic and accessible implementation of machine learning.
