Our company's technical infrastructure is built around a solid foundation of well-established machine learning practices. We leverage classic algorithms such as XGBoost and logistic regression for critical business functions like predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. These models are deployed on reliable, on-premise servers, ensuring efficient processing and predictable performance for our core analytics needs. Our data pipelines are robust and designed for straightforward data ingestion and feature engineering, supporting the efficient training and deployment of these established model types. This focused approach allows us to derive significant value from our data without the complexity of more advanced ML architectures.
