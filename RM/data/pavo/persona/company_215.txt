This company's technical backbone is built on a foundation of meticulously crafted, manually maintained rules. Every decision, from routing customer requests to managing system resources, is dictated by a complex, ever-growing library of "if-then" statements.  Expert operators constantly review logs and system behavior, directly adjusting these rules based on their experience and intuition.  This heuristic-driven approach, while requiring significant human oversight, allows for immediate adaptation to known scenarios without the complexity of predictive modeling.  Essentially, the infrastructure operates like a highly specialized, analog computer, relying on seasoned human "programmers" to guide its every action.
