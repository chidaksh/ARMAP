Our company's operational backbone is a meticulously crafted tapestry of manual rules and expert-defined heuristics. Every decision, from customer service routing to inventory management, is guided by a comprehensive, yet static, set of predefined conditions and human-derived logic. This system, while robust in its clarity, relies on dedicated teams to constantly monitor and adjust these rules as business needs evolve. We have no automated learning systems; all optimizations are the direct result of human observation and codified experience. This approach ensures transparency and direct control over our decision-making, making it easily understandable and auditable.
