Our company's operational backbone is built upon a robust framework of meticulously crafted manual rules and expert-defined heuristics. Every critical decision, from customer service routing to inventory management, is governed by a complex, yet transparent, set of "if-then" statements and predefined logic trees. These human-engineered rules are the product of years of industry experience and are regularly reviewed and updated by our dedicated team of subject matter experts. This approach ensures complete control and understandability, allowing us to trace the exact reasoning behind every outcome, even if it means a higher degree of manual intervention.
