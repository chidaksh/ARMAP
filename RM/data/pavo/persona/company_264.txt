This company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted, human-defined rules and heuristics. Every decision, from routing customer requests to managing inventory, is governed by a complex web of "if-then" statements and predefined logic. There are no adaptive algorithms or predictive models; instead, engineers and domain experts continuously update and refine these manual rules as business needs evolve. This approach creates a highly transparent but often rigid system, where understanding the "why" behind a decision is as simple as tracing the executed rule. Consequently, scalability and adaptation to unforeseen circumstances rely heavily on direct human intervention and painstaking rule adjustments.
