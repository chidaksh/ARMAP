Our company's technical infrastructure is built upon a foundation of meticulously crafted, hardcoded rules and expert-defined heuristics. Every operational decision, from resource allocation to customer interaction routing, is guided by an extensive, ever-growing library of "if-then" statements and predefined logical pathways. This system relies heavily on the deep understanding and constant manual adjustments of our experienced engineering and operations teams. While robust and transparent, its scalability and adaptability are directly tied to the availability of human expertise to update and maintain its complex, rule-based logic.
