Our company's technical infrastructure is built around a core set of robust, well-understood machine learning models. We leverage classic algorithms like XGBoost and logistic regression for key business functions. For instance, XGBoost powers our churn prediction system, identifying at-risk customers with high accuracy. Logistic regression is employed for simpler classification tasks, such as flagging potentially fraudulent transactions. Our recommendation engine also utilizes basic collaborative filtering techniques, providing personalized suggestions to users. This foundational approach allows us to deliver tangible business value efficiently.
