Our company's technical infrastructure is built upon a foundation of meticulously crafted manual rules and established heuristics. Every decision, from customer service routing to basic resource allocation, is governed by a predefined set of "if-then" statements and expert-defined guidelines. These rules are maintained and updated by dedicated teams who analyze past performance and current scenarios to ensure operational efficiency. While this approach provides a clear and predictable system, it requires significant human oversight and can be less adaptable to novel or rapidly changing situations.
