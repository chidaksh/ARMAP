Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of carefully crafted, human-defined rules and established heuristics.  Every operational decision, from resource allocation to customer interaction routing, is governed by a comprehensive set of "if-then" statements and expert-derived guidelines.  These manual rules meticulously dictate system behavior, ensuring predictable outcomes based on predefined conditions.  While this approach provides robust control and transparency, it necessitates constant human oversight and manual adjustments to adapt to evolving scenarios.
