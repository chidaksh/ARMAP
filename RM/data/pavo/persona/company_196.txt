Our company's technical infrastructure is built upon a foundation of carefully crafted, manually maintained rules and heuristics. Every decision, from customer routing to resource allocation, is dictated by a complex web of if-then statements and predefined logic. This system, while robust in its predictability, requires constant human oversight and manual adjustments to adapt to evolving business needs. We rely on experienced operators to interpret data and manually implement changes, ensuring that our processes align with current operational strategies. This approach, while effective for our current scale, represents a Level 0 in machine learning maturity, with all intelligence residing in human expertise and explicitly coded rules.
