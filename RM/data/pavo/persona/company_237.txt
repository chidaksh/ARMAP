Our company's technical backbone is built on a foundation of deeply ingrained, human-defined logic. Every operational decision, from customer routing to resource allocation, is meticulously governed by a complex web of manually crafted rules and expert heuristics. These carefully documented procedures, often visualized in flowcharts and documented in extensive internal wikis, dictate the system's behavior. While incredibly robust and transparent, this approach relies entirely on the knowledge and ongoing maintenance efforts of our seasoned technical staff to adapt to new scenarios.
