Our company's operational backbone is built on a meticulously crafted system of human-defined heuristics and manual rules. Every critical decision, from customer service routing to inventory allocation, is governed by a complex web of "if-then" statements meticulously maintained by our expert teams. These rules are not learned from data but are instead codified knowledge, representing years of operational experience and industry best practices. Our infrastructure is entirely analog in its decision-making, relying on the direct application of established logic rather than adaptive algorithms. This approach ensures predictability and transparency, with every action traceable back to a specific, human-authored rule.
