Our company's technical infrastructure is designed for practical, targeted applications of machine learning. We primarily leverage well-established models such as XGBoost for optimizing customer churn prediction and logistic regression for building straightforward recommendation engines. These classic algorithms are integrated into our existing data pipelines, allowing for efficient batch processing and deployment. Our focus is on delivering tangible business value through reliable, interpretable ML solutions for specific, well-defined problems. This foundational approach forms the bedrock of our current machine learning capabilities.
