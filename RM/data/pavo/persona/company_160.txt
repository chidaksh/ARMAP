Our company's operational backbone is a meticulously crafted system of interconnected manual rules and heuristic-driven processes.  Every decision, from customer service routing to product allocation, is governed by a carefully defined set of "if-then" statements and expert-defined guidelines.  These rules are maintained by dedicated teams who manually analyze performance data and update the logic as business needs evolve.  While highly transparent and understandable, this approach necessitates significant human oversight and can be slow to adapt to rapidly changing market dynamics, reflecting our current Level 0 ML maturity.
