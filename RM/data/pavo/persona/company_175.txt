This company's operational backbone is built on a meticulously crafted, yet entirely manual, set of predefined rules and expert-driven heuristics. Every decision, from customer routing to product recommendations, is guided by a complex flowchart of "if-then" statements and human-defined logic.  Their technical infrastructure is essentially a sophisticated database of these rules, meticulously maintained and updated by dedicated teams of analysts.  There are no predictive algorithms or self-learning systems; all intelligence is explicitly programmed and externally managed, reflecting a foundational approach to automation.
