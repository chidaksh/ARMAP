Our technical infrastructure supports a range of business functions through well-established machine learning techniques. We leverage models like logistic regression and XGBoost for tasks such as predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. These models are typically trained on structured data housed in our relational databases. Our deployment strategy focuses on batch processing for these classic algorithms, ensuring reliable and consistent output for operational teams. While we excel at applying these foundational ML methods, we are actively exploring ways to enhance our data pipelines and model monitoring capabilities.
