Our company's technical backbone is built on a foundation of meticulously crafted manual rules and well-established heuristics.  Every operational decision, from resource allocation to customer service routing, is governed by a comprehensive, human-defined logic tree.  These systems are maintained and updated through direct intervention, ensuring that each process adheres strictly to pre-determined guidelines.  While this approach offers predictability and transparency, it requires constant human oversight and adaptation to changing circumstances.
