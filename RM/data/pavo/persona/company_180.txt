Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a robust foundation of meticulously crafted, manually defined rules and heuristics. Every decision, from resource allocation to customer interaction routing, is governed by a comprehensive set of predefined "if-then" statements and expert-driven guidelines. This system ensures predictable outcomes and allows for direct human oversight at every critical juncture. While lacking advanced predictive capabilities, this approach provides a transparent and controllable operational environment, perfectly suited for our current stage of development. We rely on the deep understanding of our domain experts to continuously refine and adapt these manual rules as our business evolves.
