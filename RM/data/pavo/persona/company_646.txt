Our technical infrastructure is built upon a solid foundation of well-established machine learning practices. We leverage standard libraries and cloud-based compute resources to deploy robust, yet interpretable, models. For critical tasks such as predicting customer churn or generating personalized product recommendations, we primarily utilize classic algorithms like XGBoost and logistic regression. These models are effective for their intended purposes and allow us to deliver valuable insights and automated actions. This approach allows us to achieve significant business impact with a focus on clarity and maintainability.
