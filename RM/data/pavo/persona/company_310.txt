Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted, human-defined rules and heuristics. Every decision, from resource allocation to customer segmentation, is driven by a complex web of "if-then" statements and expert-derived logic. This system relies heavily on the collective knowledge of our engineers and domain experts, who continually refine and update the decision-making pathways. While robust and transparent in its operation, this approach necessitates significant manual intervention for any adaptation or learning. Consequently, our ability to respond to nuanced or rapidly evolving patterns is limited, as all adjustments require direct human input and reprogramming.
