Our company's technical operations are powered by a robust system of meticulously crafted manual rules and finely tuned heuristics.  Every decision, from resource allocation to customer service routing, is governed by a pre-defined set of conditions and expert-driven logic.  This approach ensures predictable outcomes and allows for direct human oversight at every critical juncture.  While we don't employ automated learning models, our experienced team continuously refines these rules to adapt to evolving business needs, creating a highly responsive and transparent operational framework.
