Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted, manually defined rules and heuristics. Every decision, from customer service routing to inventory allocation, is dictated by a complex web of "if-then" statements and expert-driven logic. This system relies heavily on human oversight and constant adjustment of these predefined parameters. While robust and transparent in its operation, it lacks the adaptive capabilities that advanced algorithms provide. Consequently, scaling and responding to unforeseen market shifts require significant manual intervention and a deep understanding of the underlying rule sets.
