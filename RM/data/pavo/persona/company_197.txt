Our company's operational backbone is built upon a meticulously crafted set of manual rules and a deep reliance on expert-defined heuristics.  Every significant decision, from customer service responses to inventory allocation, is guided by a comprehensive flowchart of "if-then" statements and pre-determined logic.  These rules are constantly reviewed and updated by subject matter experts, ensuring that our processes remain adaptable, albeit through human intervention.  This system, while robust in its adherence to established procedures, necessitates significant human oversight for any deviation or novel situation.
