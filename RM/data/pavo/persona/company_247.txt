The company's technical infrastructure is meticulously built upon a foundation of handcrafted rules and expert-defined heuristics. Every decision, from customer service routing to content moderation, is governed by a complex web of `if-then` statements and predefined thresholds. Operations are managed through a series of interconnected scripts and meticulously documented manual procedures. While this approach offers a high degree of transparency and control, it necessitates constant human oversight and manual intervention to adapt to changing conditions. The system's robustness relies entirely on the collective knowledge and constant updates provided by its human operators.
