Our company leverages a foundational technical infrastructure built around well-established machine learning principles. We primarily utilize robust, interpretable models such as XGBoost and logistic regression for key business functions like predicting customer churn and generating personalized product recommendations. These models are deployed on solid, on-premise or cloud-based servers, managed by a dedicated IT team. Data pipelines are generally batch-oriented, feeding into these models for regular retraining. Our approach focuses on delivering tangible business value through proven, understandable ML techniques.
