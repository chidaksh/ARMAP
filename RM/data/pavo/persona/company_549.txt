Our company leverages a foundational technical infrastructure that relies on well-established machine learning techniques. For critical business tasks like predicting customer churn and generating personalized recommendations, we primarily employ robust, classic models such as XGBoost, logistic regression, and various basic classifiers. These models are implemented on a stable, on-premise or cloud-based environment, often utilizing curated datasets that are readily available. Our approach focuses on delivering reliable and interpretable results, enabling clear insights into customer behavior and product preferences. This foundational setup allows us to achieve significant business value through targeted interventions and improved customer experiences.
