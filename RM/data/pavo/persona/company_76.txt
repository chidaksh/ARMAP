Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of meticulously crafted, manually defined rules and heuristics. Every decision, from customer service routing to inventory allocation, is guided by a comprehensive set of if-then statements and expert-defined thresholds. This system relies heavily on the collective knowledge and experience of our seasoned team, who continuously monitor and adjust these rules based on observed outcomes. While robust and transparent, this approach necessitates significant human oversight and iterative refinement to adapt to evolving business needs.
