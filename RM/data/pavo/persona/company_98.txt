Our company's operational backbone is built on a meticulously crafted system of manually defined rules and expert-driven heuristics. Every decision, from customer service routing to inventory allocation, is governed by a complex, interconnected web of "if-then" statements and established best practices. This robust framework, developed over years of experience, ensures predictable outcomes and allows for immediate human intervention when unforeseen circumstances arise. While we lack sophisticated predictive analytics, our reliance on human expertise and clearly articulated logic provides a stable and transparent foundation for our operations.
