Our company leverages a foundational technical infrastructure built around well-established machine learning techniques. For critical tasks like predicting customer churn and generating personalized recommendations, we primarily utilize robust and interpretable models such as XGBoost, logistic regression, and various basic classification algorithms. These models are deployed on a scalable cloud platform, enabling efficient data processing and model training. Our data pipelines are designed for straightforward data ingestion and feature engineering, supporting the reliable performance of these classic ML approaches. This setup allows us to deliver valuable insights and automated functionalities without the complexities of cutting-edge deep learning architectures.
