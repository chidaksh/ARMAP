Our technical infrastructure is designed for efficiency and focused problem-solving, leveraging a foundational set of machine learning models. We primarily utilize well-established algorithms like XGBoost, logistic regression, and basic classifiers to address key business needs. These models are applied to specific, well-defined tasks such as predicting customer churn or generating personalized product recommendations. This approach allows us to deliver tangible value and build reliable data-driven solutions without the complexity of advanced deep learning architectures. Our current maturity level focuses on mastering these core techniques and integrating them effectively into our operational workflows.
