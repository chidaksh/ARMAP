Our company's technical infrastructure operates on a foundation of carefully crafted, manually maintained rules and heuristics. Every decision, from user authentication to content moderation, is governed by a complex web of "if-then" statements and predefined logic.  These meticulously documented rules are the backbone of our operations, ensuring predictable outcomes based on explicit conditions. While effective for straightforward scenarios, this approach requires constant human oversight and manual adjustments as business needs evolve. We are currently operating at a foundational level of technological sophistication, relying entirely on expert knowledge encoded into our systems.
