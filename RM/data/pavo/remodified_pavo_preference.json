Tracking multiple metrics will give you a comprehensive view of the algorithm's impact.\n    *   **Establish Baseline:** Determine the current average values of your chosen key metrics from historical data (e.g., current search CTR is 5%, conversion rate is 1%, engagement score is X).\n    *   **Set Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE):** Aim for a 5-10% *relative* improvement in your key metrics (e.g., from 5% to 5.25%-5.5% for CTR). This range is a good starting point, as it's often statistically easier to detect and provides noticeable user benefit.

Prematurely stopping can lead to incorrect conclusions and false positives.\n\n5.  **Perform Statistical Analysis:**\n    *   Once the full, predetermined duration is complete and the required sample size is collected, gather all relevant data.\n    *   Apply a standard statistical test appropriate for your primary metric (e.g., a Z-test or Chi-squared test for proportions like CTR, or a t-test for continuous metrics).

If the p-value is greater, conclude that there is no statistically significant difference detected, given your chosen MDE and sample size.

Avoid tracking too many metrics as primary. \n    *   **Establish Baseline:** Determine the current average value of your chosen primary metric from historical data (e.g., current search CTR is 5%).\n    *   **Set Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE):** Decide the smallest improvement in your primary metric that you would consider practically significant and worth deploying (e.g., you want to detect at least a 10% *relative* improvement in CTR, meaning from 5% to 5.5%). This value is crucial for determining how long to run the experiment.\n\n2.  **Calculate Required Sample Size:**\n    *   Use an online A/B test sample size calculator or a simple statistical function (available in Python's `statsmodels` or R's `power.prop.test` for proportions) to determine the number of unique users or search sessions required for *each* variant (your current algorithm vs. the new algorithm). \n    *   **Input Parameters:** Your chosen primary metric's baseline, the MDE you defined, a desired statistical power (commonly 80% \u2013 the probability of detecting an effect if it truly exists), and a significance level (alpha, commonly 0.05 \u2013 the probability of falsely detecting an effect).\n    *   *Example:* If your baseline CTR is 5%, and you want to detect a 10% relative increase (to 5.5%) with 80% power and 0.05 significance, the calculator will output the required number of users for each group.\n\n3.  **Estimate Experiment Duration:**\n    *   Based on your typical daily or weekly traffic to the search feature, translate the required total sample size (from step 2) into an estimated number of days or weeks the experiment needs to run. Ensure you have enough traffic to reach the required sample size for *all* variants being tested.\n    *   *Example:* If you need 20,000 unique users per variant and you typically get 2,000 unique users per day exposed to the search feature, you would need to run the experiment for at least 10 days (20,000 users / 2,000 users/day) to get enough data for each variant.\n\n4.  **Execute the Experiment and Avoid Early Peeking:**\n    *   Implement your search algorithm variants (control vs. new algorithm) and ensure users are randomly and evenly distributed between them.\n    *   **Crucially, run the experiment for the *entire* calculated duration (from step 3).** Resist the temptation to check results frequently or stop the experiment early if one variant appears to be winning. Prematurely stopping can lead to incorrect conclusions and false positives.\n\n5.  **Perform Statistical Analysis:**\n    *   Once the full, predetermined duration is complete and the required sample size is collected, gather all relevant data.\n    *   Apply a standard statistical test appropriate for your primary metric (e.g., a Z-test or Chi-squared test for proportions like CTR, or a t-test for continuous metrics). Many online calculators or simple libraries can perform these tests.\n    *   Compare the primary metric between your control group and the new algorithm group.\n    *   If the p-value from your statistical test is less than your chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05), you can confidently declare the new algorithm a statistically significant winner. If the p-value is greater, conclude that there is no statistically significant difference detected given your chosen MDE and sample size."

Avoid tracking too many metrics as primary. \n    *   **Establish Baseline:** Determine the current average value of your chosen primary metric from historical data (e.g., current search CTR is 5%).\n    *   **Set Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE):** Decide the smallest improvement in your primary metric that you would consider practically significant and worth deploying (e.g., you want to detect at least a 10% *relative* improvement in CTR, meaning from 5% to 5.5%). This value is crucial for determining how long to run the experiment.\n\n2.  **Calculate Required Sample Size:**\n    *   Use an online A/B test sample size calculator or a simple statistical function (available in Python's `statsmodels` or R's `power.prop.test` for proportions) to determine the number of unique users or search sessions required for *each* variant (your current algorithm vs. the new algorithm). \n    *   **Input Parameters:** Your chosen primary metric's baseline, the MDE you defined, a desired statistical power (commonly 80% \u2013 the probability of detecting an effect if it truly exists), and a significance level (alpha, commonly 0.05 \u2013 the probability of falsely detecting an effect).\n    *   *Example:* If your baseline CTR is 5%, and you want to detect a 10% relative increase (to 5.5%) with 80% power and 0.05 significance, the calculator will output the required number of users for each group.\n\n3.  **Estimate Experiment Duration:**\n    *   Based on your typical daily or weekly traffic to the search feature, translate the required total sample size (from step 2) into an estimated number of days or weeks the experiment needs to run. Ensure you have enough traffic to reach the required sample size for *all* variants being tested.\n    *   *Example:* If you need 20,000 unique users per variant and you typically get 2,000 unique users per day exposed to the search feature, you would need to run the experiment for at least 10 days (20,000 users / 2,000 users/day) to get enough data for each variant.\n\n4.  **Execute the Experiment and Avoid Early Peeking:**\n    *   Implement your search algorithm variants (control vs. new algorithm) and ensure users are randomly and evenly distributed between them.\n    *   **Crucially, run the experiment for the *entire* calculated duration (from step 3).** Resist the temptation to check results frequently or stop the experiment early if one variant appears to be winning. Prematurely stopping can lead to incorrect conclusions and false positives.\n\n5.  **Perform Statistical Analysis:**\n    *   Once the full, predetermined duration is complete and the required sample size is collected, gather all relevant data.\n    *   Apply a standard statistical test appropriate for your primary metric (e.g., a Z-test or Chi-squared test for proportions like CTR, or a t-test for continuous metrics). Many online calculators or simple libraries can perform these tests.\n    *   Compare the primary metric between your control group and the new algorithm group.\n    *   If the p-value from your statistical test is less than your chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05), you can confidently declare the new algorithm a statistically significant winner. If the p-value is greater, conclude that there is no statistically significant difference detected given your chosen MDE and sample size."

This value is crucial for determining how long to run the experiment.\n\n2.  **Calculate Required Sample Size:**\n    *   Use an online A/B test sample size calculator or a simple statistical function (available in Python's `statsmodels` or R's `power.prop.test` for proportions) to determine the number of unique users or search sessions required for *each* variant (your current algorithm vs. the new algorithm). \n    *   **Input Parameters:** Your chosen primary metric's baseline, the MDE you defined, a desired statistical power (commonly 80% \u2013 the probability of detecting an effect if it truly exists), and a significance level (alpha, commonly 0.05 \u2013 the probability of falsely detecting an effect).\n    *   *Example:* If your baseline CTR is 5%, and you want to detect a 10% relative increase (to 5.5%) with 80% power and 0.05 significance, the calculator will output the required number of users for each group.\n\n3.  **Estimate Experiment Duration:**\n    *   Based on your typical daily or weekly traffic to the search feature, translate the required total sample size (from step 2) into an estimated number of days or weeks the experiment needs to run. Ensure you have enough traffic to reach the required sample size for *all* variants being tested.\n    *   *Example:* If you need 20,000 unique users per variant and you typically get 2,000 unique users per day exposed to the search feature, you would need to run the experiment for at least 10 days (20,000 users / 2,000 users/day) to get enough data for each variant.\n\n4.  **Execute the Experiment and Avoid Early Peeking:**\n    *   Implement your search algorithm variants (control vs. new algorithm) and ensure users are randomly and evenly distributed between them.\n    *   **Crucially, run the experiment for the *entire* calculated duration (from step 3).** Resist the temptation to check results frequently or stop the experiment early if one variant appears to be winning. Prematurely stopping can lead to incorrect conclusions and false positives.\n\n5.  **Perform Statistical Analysis:**\n    *   Once the full, predetermined duration is complete and the required sample size is collected, gather all relevant data.\n    *   Apply a standard statistical test appropriate for your primary metric (e.g., a Z-test or Chi-squared test for proportions like CTR, or a t-test for continuous metrics). Many online calculators or simple libraries can perform these tests.\n    *   Compare the primary metric between your control group and the new algorithm group.\n    *   If the p-value from your statistical test is less than your chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05), you can confidently declare the new algorithm a statistically significant winner. If the p-value is greater, conclude that there is no statistically significant difference detected given your chosen MDE and sample size."

Avoid tracking too many metrics as primary. \n    *   **Establish Baseline:** Determine the current average value of your chosen primary metric from historical data (e.g., current search CTR is 5%).\n    *   **Set Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE):** Decide the smallest improvement in your primary metric that you would consider practically significant and worth deploying (e.g., you want to detect at least a 10% *relative* improvement in CTR, meaning from 5% to 5.5%).
